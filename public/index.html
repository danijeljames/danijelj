		<p>How did the day start? Perfect. I went to get Jake to start the day. 😍</p>

<p>First we went to the HMAS Adelaide Open Day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/26/DJW.20160626.iPhone6SPlus.3303.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="HMAS Adelaide" alt="HMAS Adelaide"></p>

<p>Afterwards Jake and I were supposed to go on the Dolphin Cruise <em>(he&rsquo;s so sneaky, he organised this without telling me!)</em> but we missed that because the tour of the ship took longer than it was supposed to. How did I ever deserve this man? What did I do? I don&rsquo;t know. All I know, is this is the perfect life.</p>

<p>We thought about it, and I suggested Hahndorf. On the way, we went to a winery to do a cheese and wine testing. I&rsquo;ve never done this before! So why not?</p>

<p>Jake brought me to Shaw &amp; Smith cellar door where we took a flight. A wine flight! Did you know that? Tell me I&rsquo;m not the only silly person who doesn&rsquo;t know these things? A wine flight!? Ha! What a cute name. So we took a trip together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/26/DJW.20160626.iPhone6SPlus.3347.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Wine Flight" alt="Wine Flight"></p>

<p>After this wonderful matching we headed into Hahndorf, stopped at a market, then across the road to the candy shop and then back here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/26/DJW.20160626.iPhone6SPlus.3355.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="I want all the candy" alt="I want all the candy"></p>

<p>Unfortunately after dinner I had to bring Jake home. He wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to sleep at my place because the bed is quite hard. 😔</p>

<blockquote><p>Jake, take me home&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, I can hardly hold back my anticipation. There is going to be a day in the future, when I can fall over drunk and turn to this man, and say to him, <em>&ldquo;Jake, take me home&rdquo;</em> and we&rsquo;ll be going back to the same place that we both share together. Our house. Our home. And we&rsquo;ll have a cute dog.</p>

<p>Hopefully the lady next door won&rsquo;t grow ugly tulips so I don&rsquo;t have to complain! 😂</p>

<blockquote><p>11:11, make a wish&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s just passed 11:11 as I&rsquo;m writing this, so make a wish. ✨</p>

<p>My wish, is simple. For Jake &amp; Danijel <code>#jakeanddanijel</code> to enjoy a long and wonderful life full of laughter, smiles and wonderful memories.</p>

<p>Goodnight!</p>

			spicy chiken chipotle white pumpkin fettuccini</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ever had the idea to fusion two dishes together and hope it go well? I did. And it worked! 🙌🏻</p>

<p>Taking the idea of carbonara being a white-sauced bacon dish and pumpkin fetta pasta, I thought to myself, why can&rsquo;t I make this into two new dishes? It can&rsquo;t be that hard, can it?</p>

<p>First things first, Jake likes spicy food. Not spicy enough to burn a new hole in your arse, but something nice. 🌶🌶🌶😋 Why not try to make the base of both these dishes into something new and use some of my chipotle sauce to bring it together? It&rsquo;s worth a shot! 🔫</p>

<p>Pumpkin in a pasta dish need to be firm, so I took some kent and butternut pumpkins and roasted them with olive oil, thyme, cracked pepper and salt crystals and ground salt for ~45mins @ 180°C <em>(fan forced)</em> and then left them in there until I was ready. I did turn them about half way through to make sure they baked evenly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3126.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="roast pumpkin cubes" alt="roast pumpkin cubes"></p>

<p>On to the main dish. Starting with onion, I sweated it until it became translucent and added chilli then chicken and a glob of my chipotle sauce. It needed to mix around and get juicy on a low temperature to bind the flavours. Added some more salt.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3125.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="create the chicken base" alt="create the chicken base"></p>

<p>Why all the salt? Well, saw this crazy Korean woman <em>(Maangchi)</em> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?gl=AU&amp;hl=en-GB">YouTube</a> when she started with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNKal3PI_Q">Korean style iced coffee - Naeng-keopi: 냉커피</a> and then followed her around and saw lots of videos that use salt - a lot of salt! I&rsquo;m surprised she didn&rsquo;t put salt in her iced coffee! 😂</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/20160620.Maangchi.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="Maangchi" alt="Maanghi"></p>

<p>Anyway, back to the dish at hand. 😁</p>

<p>So then you skin and chop up some mushrooms, fry for a bit on low heat, add chopped bacon, fry some more, add &frac12; cup of white wine <em>(something cheap will do)</em>, add &frac12; cup of chicken or vegetable stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins. Add the chicken stuff to this, including all the juices and add about &frac12; cup of cream and simmer for 10 mins.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3137.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="sauce is ready" alt="sauce is ready"></p>

<p>Right before serving, add the pumpkin we made earlier and some baby spinach and stir until the spinach is wilted. Get your pasta ready and put it on the bowls, scoop some sauce on top and serve!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3140.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="perfect dish" alt="perfect dish"></p>

<p>I get called a <code>#masterchef</code> by Jake all the time. Half of me believes because he loves me so much, the other half because of the taste I procure to his palate!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3144.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="bowls are clean" alt="bowls are clean"></p>

<p>A clean bowl is a perfect dish ✌️</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Does the saying go <em>&ldquo;Waiter, there&rsquo;s a spider in my soup&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Ma'am, there&rsquo;s a spider on my cutlery&rdquo;</em> ? I always thought it was the former, no ?</p>

<p>We went this morning for breakfast to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/swedish-tarts-semaphore">Swedish Tarts</a> for crêpes, what else ? Well, in short, bad service, a messed up order, spiders on our cutlery, hair on our crêpes, aged berries, and coffee served wrong. 😡 It wasn&rsquo;t a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2858.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="a spider on my cuterly" alt="a spider on my cuterly"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been here before for breakfast once, and Jake was just here not yesterday to pick up coffee for us to have with our homemade breakfast - so what happened today ? I can&rsquo;t say that I was even slightly delighted at the whole experience. Though the food does look amazing, I dare say.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2855.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="mixed berries crêpes" alt="mixed berries crêpes"></p>

<p>So the presentation of these images can save the day. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the finer details of what happened, but we got a refund on one of the crêpes <em>(the one with the hair on it)</em> but Jake didn&rsquo;t feel like really eating after that. 😔</p>

<p>So we took a selfie.</p>

<p>What really annoyed me the most about this whole situation was my coffee wasn&rsquo;t served in a takeaway cup and the lady serving me was more interested in telling me about their three store locations so I didn&rsquo;t have to come out all this way just to get it in a takeaway cup&hellip;I still wanted it in a takeaway cup, luv !</p>

<p>To rectify this Jake brought me to a place called <a href="http://theredmillbakehouse.com.au">The Red Mill Caffé</a> and saved the day. Yay. Great little place. Can&rsquo;t wait to write up my review on <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/">Yelp!</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to make food for Jake for the rest of his life. I think my experience with the kitchen and food is enough to bring to our relationship that something that will last our lifetime spent together. I do hope he knows how much I love him. He&rsquo;s the sunshine on a rainy day for me.</p>

<p>Did Tom like the soufflé, naturally of course. Whipped cream and all !</p>

			hello paddy's lantern</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Arriving back here in Adelaide on March 3rd this year, one of the first things I did was take to social platform <a href="http://www.grindr.com">Grindr</a> to get a feel from everyone where the best coffee shops were. Yesterday I was talking to Jakey and asked him if he&rsquo;s ever heard of <a href="http://paddyslantern.com.au">Paddy&rsquo;s Lantern</a>. Unfortunately not, and I did leave it to the last two of places to still check out.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember who referred me this venue, but thank you, whoever you are ! It was an absolute delight !</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/1438068476190.png" width="800" height="500" title="paddys lantern" alt="paddys lantern"></p>

<p>Nested in the suburban district of Adelaide hidden amongst the old houses at 219 Gilbert Street, this little niche cafe can be found.</p>

<p>The food was amazing, coffee was amazing and to top it off - the service was brilliant !</p>

<p>I picked myself the <em>2 Fried Eggs w/ Spicy Relish on Sourdough Toast</em> and at only $13 this was a total bargain ! You can&rsquo;t go wrong with the perfectly cooked eggs, rustic sourdough, and devilish homemade spicy relish. Mmmmm !</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.091706.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="Eggs, Spicy Relish, Sourdough" alt="Eggs, Spicy Relish, Sourdough"></p>

<p>I also got my standard large size soy latte, no sugar as this is what I really came for. Keeping up standards, I had it served in a takeaway cup. I was a little taken back by the service of being offered my cup still on a saucer, and not just handed to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.091446.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="soy latte takeaway" alt="soy latte takeaway"></p>

<p>The print on the cups is faded, but even so it&rsquo;s still so cute ! 😊 I can&rsquo;t delay my observations of a full bodied flavour with amazing texture steamed perfectly and no burning with a lasting aroma - wow ! This has to be <em>the</em> coffee in Adelaide. They deserve the 4&frac12; stars awarded to them on <a href="http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/paddys-lantern-adelaide">Yelp!</a> too !</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.093056.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="second coffee to go thnx" alt="second coffee to go thnx"></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the area and you want amazing breakfast, please head on down there, bring your partner, work colleagues or a friend and enjoy the simplicity of the atmosphere, the warmth of the service, the spectacular tastes of the products and most importantly - experience it for yourself !</p>
