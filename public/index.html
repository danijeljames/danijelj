			Mardi Gras 2016</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Get out your glitter, <a href="https://smirnoff.com">vodka</a>, <a href="https://aussiebum.com.au">speedos</a>, tune into <a href="https://sbs.com.au">SBS</a> and log off <a href="https://grindr.com">Grindr</a>, it&rsquo;s that time of year as the Sydney Mardi Gras has arrived! Sporting some of the most fabulous attitudes, fashions and wigs you&rsquo;ve seen this side of the globe it&rsquo;s Christmas for the Gays!</p>

<p>Having been an avid fan of the Mardi Gras for as long as I can remember I was able to work in the Control Room last year being the sole point of contact for the parade floats as they eagerly awaited instructions to step out onto route from Hyde Park. <em>What could go wrong?&ldquo;</em> I asked myself as I volunteered to take the position that everyone else seemed reluctant to raise their hands&hellip;what did go wrong indeed! We survived, and we&rsquo;ll continue to survive for as long as an iota of flair exists - we&rsquo;ll take it and run a marathon.</p>

<div align="center"> <img src="images/2016/03/20160305.iPhone6Plus.smirnoff_mardi_gras.jpeg" width="800" height="800" title="smirnoff mardi gras 2016 rainbow cup oxford st sydney" alt="Smirnoff & Sydney Mardi Gras"> </div>


<p>This year I decided to part ways with Sydney before the Mardi Gras parade and step away from everything in silence. I&rsquo;m currently aboard <a href="https://virginaustralia.com.au">Virgin</a> flight VA412 where I hope <em>(yes, hope!)</em> to be greeted by my parents upon landing and brought to my new house.</p>

<p>There will be no celebrations tonight, maybe just coffee with an old friend that time has kept tucked away and my camera in hand. Who ever said it&rsquo;s kosher for a photographer to not have his camera on hand anyway? It&rsquo;s always socially acceptable. üòÄ</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already had my celebrations last night on Oxford St one last time and take this little token with me where I go.</p>

<p>To everyone out and about in Sydney tonight, please stay safe, stay happy, stay fabulous and enjoy this special occasion. Don&rsquo;t forget to tag your posts with <code>#MardiGras</code> so that we can find them later and share in the joy.</p>

<p>And to the man in front of me, if you move your fucking chair one more time I&rsquo;ll karate punch you to the fanny! üò°</p>

<p>On a lighter note, you&rsquo;ll know when you arrive in Adelaide and can see the familiar red signage of <a href="https://cibo.com.au">„Äåcibo„Äç</a> in front of you!</p>

<div align="center"> <img src="/images/2016/03/20160305.iPhone6S.180856.800res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="cibo expresso" alt="„Äåcibo„Äç espresso Adelaide Airport"> </div>


<p>Amazing coffee, and simple menu. You should try it when <em>(not if)</em> you take a stroll down any of Adelaide&rsquo;s iconic suburbs.</p>

			goodbye healthdirect</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember the first time I was contacted about a position at <a href="https://healthdirect.org.au">Healthdirect Australia</a>. I never applied for the job, I was asked to go to an interview that had been tee&rsquo;d up! Was I being head-hunted for this role or did someone pass my name along as a favour? I never found out and sometimes it&rsquo;s better to not know the whole story anyway!</p>

<p>6 months have passed <em>(a week)</em> since that first time and here we are parting ways. It must be said that Healthdirect and all her employees have been truly monumental in my career development and integral to my development as a person. I cannot express in words how overwhelmed I have been with the reception from the company as I parted ways today. Thank you, everyone!</p>

<p>For the usual send-off, the Corporate IT team will head down and enjoy lunch <i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i> together in honour of the person who&rsquo;s departing or their birthday. We enjoyed a meal at <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/misschu-sydney">MissChu</a>, one of my favourite Vietnamese shops in all of Sydney. After this we headed up to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/aqua-s-sydney">Aqua S</a>, where we all enjoyed their delicious Sea Salt &amp; Pandam iceream.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160304.iPhone6Plus.132515.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="aqua S sea salt & pandam" alt="aqua S - sea salt & pandam icecream"></p>

<p>This icecream not only matters to me as an indicator to the end of our relationship Healthdirect, but also as the cornerstone of a friendship I share with <a href="https://instagram.com/mynameisdanger">Danger Del Rey</a>, the cutest drag queen you&rsquo;ve ever seen fall from Asia into our laps. Check her out sometime.</p>

<p>I reflect on the memories of the last 6 months and wouldn&rsquo;t trade a single moment for anything. Every step of the way with this organisation has been totally fruitful and very organic and I&rsquo;ve made some very good long-term friends from this.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you everyone for everything you&rsquo;ve offered me. Let us not say &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;, but instead <em>(as the French would have it)</em> <em>&ldquo;au revoir!&rdquo;</em></p>

			around sydney are memories</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I sometimes feel disconnected from the world around me and find solace with my Canon 600D walking around until it&rsquo;s really late at night just capturing moments of people around me. This can be here in Sydney or any other part of the world. Tonight I conned Jet and Tomas into being dragged around Sydney until the ungodly hours of the morning (I think we finished up around 1 ?) so I could retrace some places that Grenouille and I had been to on our adventures.</p>

<p>If I were to write a romance novel, it would be the moment I met him for dinner and drinks after work right up until the last we saw each other one last time at Hobart airport. But I don‚Äôt want to touch on that yet. Maybe one day I‚Äôll come back to visit that story.</p>

<p>We were retracing all the magical places I‚Äôve never seen before when Grenouille and I walked around. No destination in mind, just leaving the blind to lead the blind. I followed him and he followed me, just anywhere but home.</p>

<p>Looking back on it all, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single street I cannot now pass here in Sydney where I wasn‚Äôt following Grenouille, even to the deepest parts of the harbor - we saw it all!</p>

<p>Jet and Tomas haven‚Äôt been up near the new development that is known as Barangaroo. So we retraced the steps that were taken before across many journeys and it‚Äôs sad to say, that I‚Äôll probably not be here to see the final bricks to be laid for the most beautiful buildings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/02/2016-02-27_DJW.0466.800res.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="‚Äòview of Barangaroo‚Äô ‚Äòview of Barangaroo‚Äô" ></p>

<p>I think the one on the left is the new casino. I‚Äôm not sure ? Maybe someone will drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/danijeljames">@danijeljames</a> and fill me in ?</p>

<p>The first time we came across Barangaroo was just after being up at the Observatory in the front gardens and we‚Äôd kissed under the white wood hut <em>(I don‚Äôt have a better description)</em> out the front. I remember leaning in to him and kissing him up his neck and him whispering to me ‚ÄòFuck you, Danijel James ≈†imunov!‚Äô. Glorious !</p>

<p>In short, ‚Äôtis a sight to see. I‚Äôd like to elaborate more on this article at a later stage and share some of the imagery from that night. I think there was a reflection of blue throughout most of the images and bring together all the important places.</p>

<p>One of the most magical places to visit at night, if you ever get the chance is the Observatory Hill Gazebo. It looks out across the northern side of the harbor, so over Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, Sydney Opera House and right out to the ocean. So beautiful the way the light dances off the water at night and captures the essence of love.</p>

<p>We stood there for a while as he taught me words like arbre, blanc, rouge, l‚Äôherb, verde. Recounting the objects around us, their names an the colors their transpire from. I still couldn‚Äôt say arbre. LOL ! Bats are called bald mice, but I can‚Äôt remember the words, as it was a mouthful. I just wanted to touch him and give him a kiss the first time we were there. It was before the first time we‚Äôd kissed when we went there. From the expressions of Jet and Tomas, I think they enjoyed the night overall, and the gazebo, both never having seen the view before.</p>

<h4>Install FUSE for OS X</h4>

<p>Install FUSE for OS X first, it&rsquo;s the base for connecting 3rd party file systems to the machine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/02/2016-02-21_FUSE.for.OSX.png" width="312" height="219" title="ensure all options are checked" alt="FUSE for OS X"></p>

<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://osxfuse.github.io/">FUSE for OS X</a></p>

<h3>Install NTFS-3G</h3>

<p>Installing NTFS-3G enables the actual read/write to NTFS formatted drives. During install there is an option to use <code>No caching</code> or <code>UBLIO caching</code>. In my experience it&rsquo;s better to use <code>No caching</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/02/2016-02-21_to.cache.or.not.to.cache.png" width="312" height="220" title="to cache or not to cache" alt="UBLIO caching NTFS-3G"></p>

<p>Once this has been installed restart the machine.</p>

<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/2010/10/ntfs-3g-for-mac-os-x-2010102.html">NTFS-3G</a></p>

<h3>Install fuse-wait</h3>

<p>Post-reboot you will get the following error message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/02/2016-02-21_reboot.error.png" width="211" height="109" title="NTFS-3G post install error" alt="NTFS-3G post install error"></p>

<p>fuse-wait is a patch for NTFS-3G that just stops this annoying error messages from appearing on your system.</p>

		<p>Sitting on my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, QF77, retrospectivey I have mixed emotions about the hospitality of people from Tasmania. In this hand it had to be one of the worst places for anyone to experience a welcome in all of Australia. And that includes Sydney. Disgusting. What happened to the good framework that this country was built upon? My travelling companion Grenouille (üê∏), may not have been able to understand the dymanics of three particular situations that played out at hand but I certainly did! On the other hand we were greeted like a lost stranger that had a reservation waiting to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>I arrived at <a href="http://www.hotbartinternational.com.au">Hobart Internaitional Airport</a> and was taken back at how small this place is. Really? This is an international travel destination? It&rsquo;s not even half the size of the old Adelaide International Airport before it was revamped a few years ago. Weird.</p>

<p>Getting off the plane my first messages from Grenouille warm and fuzzy until I was told the car licence was forgot and left behind. LOL! Double LOL! So Grenouille went back towards his place of stay and I resorted to my UK licence. Yes, scary as it may be for a lot of people, I do have a valid international licence and it won&rsquo;t be taken away from me. Yet. üòù</p>

		<p>Grenouille and I were walking along Lagon Beach and he was just out in front of me. Not wanting to be part of my public images <em>(boring, I know right?)</em> I can&rsquo;t post his face, but he did jump as he stepped onto a slippery rock and I couldn&rsquo;t help but take this shot as my trusty 600D was poised and ready to fire.</p>

I take the original image and apply my Adelaide Filter, Fireworks T2, and then Fireworks T2 with greyscale. The result combination gives me this silver effect to the image and brings out the high grain and contrast that is normally not visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a side-effect can be the final image will give any skin a &ldquo;rippened&rdquo; effect and all the small contours, spots and stains on your skin will show up.</p>

<p>Personally, I love this. I feel it truly brings out the character of the subject and lets you see them for what they really are. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing images in magazines of models sprawled across the glossy pages exposing their overlay of beauty. Real beauty comes from within. It&rsquo;s not something that can be measured by scienctific <em>(FR:scientifique)</em> methods but by the beat of one&rsquo;s own heart.</p>

<p>Essentially, I think he&rsquo;s beautiful in all the images I don&rsquo;t publish. I keep them safe and secure as I&rsquo;m asked. Grenouille is beautiful on the inside as this seeps through his skin to the outside too.</p>

<p>Retrospectively, HDR images are a combination of 3 - underexposed, exposed and overexposed. Alternatively you can use high colour capture, low colour capture and middle colour capture. This allows you to expose all the areas of an image and blend them into a single frame. I don&rsquo;t like the standard HDR except when I need to bring out the sky against a darkly lit forground. Even then I have other tricks that I use in Lightroom to aid me with the final resolution.</p>

<p>Bottom line, if you&rsquo;re too often relying on hardware or software to take amazing photos, you&rsquo;re clearly not trying hard enough. Try, try and try again. Without practice you can&rsquo;t believe in yourself. Once upon a time I sucked too. In fact sometimes I pour over my images and want to discard them becasue they&rsquo;re ugly and resort to Lightroom. When I get the final result I just delete them from my Catalog. Nobody wants a Adobe-edited image. It&rsquo;s so fake!</p>

<p>Keep up the good work and eventually you&rsquo;ll get there! üòâüç∑</p>
