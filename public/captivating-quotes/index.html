    <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Stop waiting for Friday, for summer, for a boy to fall in love with you. Happiness is achieved when you stop waiting for it and make something of the moment you are in right now.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Don’t even bother with apologies if you’re still going to do the things you’re sorry for.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of wasting your life giving second chances to those who don’t deserve it, give a first chance to someone who does.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>I don’t want your car, your money or your gifts. I want your time, your smile, your honesty, your effort and I’ll put you as a priority.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of the biggest challenge in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something. They’re dying to find someone who’s going to make them feel good. In reality, the only way a relationship will last if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give, and not a place you go to take.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>When someone does something wrong, don’t forget all the things they did right.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Those who truly care for you will he happy just to see you happy.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Just hug them tighter when they’re about to let go, the sheer love during that moment is unmatched.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>If I could have just one wish, I would wish to wake up everyday to the sound of your breath on my neck, the warmth of your lips on my cheek, the touch of your fingers on my skin, and the feel of your heart beating with mine&hellip; Knowing that I could never find that feeling with anyone other than you.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are hating yourself for not letting go of someone who makes you sad, don’t. The only reason you’re still trying with them is because at some point they made you smile.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Never get attracted by wealth or good looks, they both fade. Get attracted by the person who makes you smile.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>I just want you, that’s it. All your flaws, mistakes, smiles, giggles, jokes, sarcasm. Everything. I just want you.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Relationships fail because people take their own insecurities and try and twist them into their partner’s flaws.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Love is supposed to be about being able to expose your partner’s complete spectrum and choosing to bring out their best side.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>A good life is when you smile often, dream big, laugh a lot and realise how blessed you are for what you have.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>You deserve someone who knows that you’re not really perfect. Yet they stare at you like you are the most perfect person they have ever seen.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Two people don’t have to be together right now, in a month, or in a year. If those two people are meant to be, then they will be together somehow at sometime in life.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to be in my life, the door is open. If you want to go, the door is right there. Just don’t stand in the doorway.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Ever since we met, I’ve known that we’re special. That the way we talk and laugh around each other is different than everybody else. That I will never meet anyone I can trust as much as I trust you. And I think most people search their whole lives to find what we’ve already had.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Time is one of the most expensive gifts to give someone. When someone gives you their time, cherish it. It’s priceless.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Someone who really loves you sees what a mess you can be, how moody you can get, how hard you are to handle, but still wants you in their life.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>You don’t have to tell me everything. Just don’t lie to me.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>We plan things. But we usually fall in love with the most unexpected person at the most unexpected time and end up going to unexpected places we never knew existed.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>There’s always that one person who can send you a text and cause you to smile instantly.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>The greatest relationships are the ones you never expected to be in. The ones that swept you off your feet and challenged every view you’ve ever had.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Under 400 die from swine flu and everybody wants to wear a mask. 33 million live with HIV and no one wants to wear a condom.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>That moment when you can actually feel the pain in your chest from seeing or hearing something that breaks your heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>In a wonderful world, order and chaos is no contradiction at all.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Someday, we’ll forget the hurt, the reason we cried, and who caused us pain. We will finally realise that the secret of being free is not revenge, but letting things unfurl in their own way and own time. After all, what matters is not the first, but the last chapter of our life which shows how well we ran the race. So smile, laugh, forgive, believe, and love all over again.</p></blockquote>
