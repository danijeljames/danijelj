	<h2 class="title">around sydney are memories</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>I sometimes feel disconnected from the world around me and find solace with my Canon 600D walking around until it&rsquo;s really late at night just capturing moments of people around me. This can be here in Sydney or any other part of the world. Tonight I conned Jet and Tomas into being dragged around Sydney until the ungodly hours of the morning (I think we finished up around 1 ?) so I could retrace some places that Grenouille and I had been to on our adventures.</p>

<p>If I were to write a romance novel, it would be the moment I met him for dinner and drinks after work right up until the last we saw each other one last time at Hobart airport. But I don’t want to touch on that yet. Maybe one day I’ll come back to visit that story.</p>

<p>We were retracing all the magical places I’ve never seen before when Grenouille and I walked around. No destination in mind, just leaving the blind to lead the blind. I followed him and he followed me, just anywhere but home.</p>

<p>Looking back on it all, I don’t think there’s a single street I cannot now pass here in Sydney where I wasn’t following Grenouille, even to the deepest parts of the harbor - we saw it all!</p>

<p>Jet and Tomas haven’t been up near the new development that is known as Barangaroo. So we retraced the steps that were taken before across many journeys and it’s sad to say, that I’ll probably not be here to see the final bricks to be laid for the most beautiful buildings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/02/2016-02-27_DJW.0466.800res.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="‘view of Barangaroo’ ‘view of Barangaroo’" ></p>

<p>I think the one on the left is the new casino. I’m not sure ? Maybe someone will drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/danijeljames">@danijeljames</a> and fill me in ?</p>

<p>The first time we came across Barangaroo was just after being up at the Observatory in the front gardens and we’d kissed under the white wood hut <em>(I don’t have a better description)</em> out the front. I remember leaning in to him and kissing him up his neck and him whispering to me ‘Fuck you, Danijel-James Wynyard Šimunov!’. Glorious !</p>

<p>In short, ’tis a sight to see. I’d like to elaborate more on this article at a later stage and share some of the imagery from that night. I think there was a reflection of blue throughout most of the images and bring together all the important places.</p>

<p>One of the most magical places to visit at night, if you ever get the chance is the Observatory Hill Gazebo. It looks out across the northern side of the harbor, so over Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, Sydney Opera House and right out to the ocean. So beautiful the way the light dances off the water at night and captures the essence of love.</p>

<p>We stood there for a while as he taught me words like arbre, blanc, rouge, l’herb, verde. Recounting the objects around us, their names an the colors their transpire from. I still couldn’t say arbre. LOL ! Bats are called bald mice, but I can’t remember the words, as it was a mouthful. I just wanted to touch him and give him a kiss the first time we were there. It was before the first time we’d kissed when we went there. From the expressions of Jet and Tomas, I think they enjoyed the night overall, and the gazebo, both never having seen the view before.</p>
