<div class="entry-content"><p>A late start today. I had intended to get up early, go out, have coffee and pastry, peruse around the city soaking in the places I&rsquo;ve not seen since yesteryear and try to find the new changes. I was only here recently in Adelaide for the Healthdirect Christmas break plus a few days, but I was more of a tourist then. I had no intentions to settle down here for a bit and stand still a little while. Now I&rsquo;m back&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Badger <em>(his nickname, I didn&rsquo;t give it to &lsquo;im)</em> has given me a recommendation for coffee this morning. I finally got to the city just after 13:00 and had a walk down memory lane - <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Leigh+St,+Adelaide+SA+5000/@-34.8450789,138.5735432,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ab0cf28363480a7:0xa7fac227eb958f23">Leigh St</a> - where years ago my ex partner Mike and I had a cafe. Actually, we had a cafe on Leigh St, Topham Mall and &hellip; I forgot the connecting street on the other side of Leigh St. I wanna say Bent St, but that doesn&rsquo;t sound right. I guess I could <a href="https://maps.google.com.au">Google</a> it, meh.</p>

<p>So anyway, got into the city, walked down Leigh St, fabulous culture nestled up here hidden away from the dredges of Hindley St. No hookers. Drugs. Habbibi&rsquo;s. Nada! I spotted a little French restaurant that I&rsquo;d like to go back and try this week, people sitting outside laughing and enjoying their Indian meals <em>(were they Halal&nbsp;?)</em> and the vibe was just there. It&rsquo;s almost brewing into a hipster lifestyle.</p>

<p>Stumbling up the little lane with my eyes peeled for everything around me, I found <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/coffee-branch-adelaide">coffee branch</a>, a virtual hole-in-the-wall type shop. You shuffle in, you order, you shuffle out with coffee in hand and some pastry too! I myself got a <a href="http://www.milo.com.au">Milo-flavoured</a> cronut. First thing I noticed was the style. Very hipster! If I closed my eyes and opened them between Newtown and Adelaide I&rsquo;d hardly notice any difference. The price of soy, coconut and almond milk was a little steep <em>(80¬¢ Adelaide vs 50¬¢ Sydney)</em> but well worth it for the overall cost. Friendly staff, amazing decor, profiled origin, chalkboards, a grade of rustic - it was pretty much love at first sight!</p>

<p>I ordered my usual large soy latte, no sugar thnx ‚òïÔ∏è ‚úåüèª</p>

<p>After a few minutes they called out my name and I shuffled out of the store and out the front to the tables to grab a quick snap of my cup. It&rsquo;s totally adorable!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.125225.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="coffee from coffee branch on leigh st" alt="coffee branch : 32 leigh st : Adelaide"></p>

<p>Any shop that wants to precede it&rsquo;s reputation will use custom printed cups. Not only does it embed their brand in my mind, it&rsquo;s associative with the quality - let&rsquo;s tuck in!</p>

<p>First sip, clearly burnt my tongue. Why do I do this every time to myself&nbsp;? Seriously I&rsquo;m stupid at the best of times&nbsp;! üòÇ Maybe this is why I&rsquo;m single still&nbsp;? üòè Second sip, yeurk! What is this&nbsp;? It&rsquo;s strong&nbsp;! It&rsquo;s real coffee&nbsp;! I honestly hadn&rsquo;t expected this. I need another sip. <em><em>sips coffee</em></em> Wow&nbsp;! This is amazing&nbsp;!</p>

<p>I can safely say this is a 4&#189; star rating coffee from me to you. I&rsquo;m going to review them later on Yelp! and go back for some more photos of the joint. I&rsquo;m adding this to a list later and will be back to visit sometime again soon. Give it a shot&nbsp;! <em>(excuse the pun)</em></p>

<p>Moving along to <a href="http://rundlemall.com">Rundle Mall</a>, I swooped in to grab the obligatory selfie in the Malls Balls and then grabbed another few pics that just show this timeless piece of artwork. The Rundle Mall Balls are a central icon to the city and I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;d be with out them&nbsp;!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160306.iPhone6Plus.1473.800res.jpg" width="800" height="500" title="Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls" alt="Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls"></p>

<p>One of the greatest things to do in a new city is just walk around and admire the public art. Spouted as the artsy capital of Australia, Melbourne has a plethora of magical art in all forms for the public to admire. It gives a sense of culture to the city. Adelaide, the Festival State, traditionally known for churches and theatre is slowly creeping up with awesome installations popping up all over the place. It&rsquo;s not like thy&rsquo;ve tried to copy any other setups across the globe, but reinvent the wheel with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_art_in_South_Australia">own attractions</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.1744.600res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="artwork in Rundle Mall" alt="Rundle Mall D20 bronze artwork"></p>

<p>Not sure what what you&rsquo;d call this, but I dub it the <strong>Rundle Mall D20</strong>. I&rsquo;m not counting the sides, but it was pretty to look at, nice and shiny, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having one in my front yard to look at each morning.</p>
