    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever had the idea to fusion two dishes together and hope it go well? I did. And it worked! 🙌🏻</p>

<p>Taking the idea of carbonara being a white-sauced bacon dish and pumpkin fetta pasta, I thought to myself, why can&rsquo;t I make this into two new dishes? It can&rsquo;t be that hard, can it?</p>

<p>First things first, Jake likes spicy food. Not spicy enough to burn a new hole in your arse, but something nice. 🌶🌶🌶😋 Why not try to make the base of both these dishes into something new and use some of my chipotle sauce to bring it together? It&rsquo;s worth a shot! 🔫</p>

<p>Pumpkin in a pasta dish need to be firm, so I took some kent and butternut pumpkins and roasted them with olive oil, thyme, cracked pepper and salt crystals and ground salt for ~45mins @ 180°C <em>(fan forced)</em> and then left them in there until I was ready. I did turn them about half way through to make sure they baked evenly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3126.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;roast pumpkin cubes&rsquo; &lsquo;roast pumpkin cubes&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>On to the main dish. Starting with onion, I sweated it until it became translucent and added chilli then chicken and a glob of my chipotle sauce. It needed to mix around and get juicy on a low temperature to bind the flavours. Added some more salt.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3125.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;create the chicken base&rsquo; &lsquo;create the chicken base&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Why all the salt? Well, saw this crazy Korean woman <em>(Maangchi)</em> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?gl=AU&amp;hl=en-GB">YouTube</a> when she started with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNKal3PI_Q">Korean style iced coffee - Naeng-keopi: 냉커피</a> and then followed her around and saw lots of videos that use salt - a lot of salt! I&rsquo;m surprised she didn&rsquo;t put salt in her iced coffee! 😂</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/20/20160620.Maangchi.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;Maangchi&rsquo; &lsquo;Maanghi&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Anyway, back to the dish at hand. 😁</p>

<p>So then you skin and chop up some mushrooms, fry for a bit on low heat, add chopped bacon, fry some more, add &frac12; cup of white wine <em>(something cheap will do)</em>, add &frac12; cup of chicken or vegetable stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins. Add the chicken stuff to this, including all the juices and add about &frac12; cup of cream and simmer for 10 mins.</p>

<p>Right before serving, add the pumpkin we made earlier and some baby spinach and stir until the spinach is wilted. Get your pasta ready and put it on the bowls, scoop some sauce on top and serve!</p>

<p>I get called a <code>#masterchef</code> by Jake all the time. Half of me believes because he loves me so much, the other half because of the taste I procure to his palate!</p>

<p>A clean bowl is a perfect dish ✌️</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/06/13/a-spider-on-my-cutlery</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Does the saying go <em>&ldquo;Waiter, there&rsquo;s a spider in my soup&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Ma'am, there&rsquo;s a spider on my cutlery&rdquo;</em> ? I always thought it was the former, no ?</p>

<p>We went this morning for breakfast to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/swedish-tarts-semaphore">Swedish Tarts</a> for crêpes, what else ? Well, in short, bad service, a messed up order, spiders on our cutlery, hair on our crêpes, aged berries, and coffee served wrong. 😡 It wasn&rsquo;t a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2858.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="&lsquo;a spider on my cuterly&rsquo; &lsquo;a spider on my cuterly&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been here before for breakfast once, and Jake was just here not yesterday to pick up coffee for us to have with our homemade breakfast - so what happened today ? I can&rsquo;t say that I was even slightly delighted at the whole experience. Though the food does look amazing, I dare say.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2855.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="&lsquo;mixed berries crêpes&rsquo; &lsquo;mixed berries crêpes&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So the presentation of these images can save the day. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the finer details of what happened, but we got a refund on one of the crêpes <em>(the one with the hair on it)</em> but Jake didn&rsquo;t feel like really eating after that. 😔</p>

<p>So we took a selfie.</p>

<p>What really annoyed me the most about this whole situation was my coffee wasn&rsquo;t served in a takeaway cup and the lady serving me was more interested in telling me about their three store locations so I didn&rsquo;t have to come out all this way just to get it in a takeaway cup&hellip;I still wanted it in a takeaway cup, luv !</p>

<p>To rectify this Jake brought me to a place called <a href="http://theredmillbakehouse.com.au">The Red Mill Caffé</a> and saved the day. Yay. Great little place. Can&rsquo;t wait to write up my review on <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/">Yelp!</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I met Ralf, Jake&rsquo;s dog since he was a kid. Ralf is 9 years old now :-)</p>

<p>I know they belong together because they both have the same attitude and facials. Could you ask for anymore proof that a dog resembles its' master ?</p>

<p>Apart from the kind nature of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar_Pei">Shar Pei</a>, I cannot fathom what makes him just so adorable ! All I know, is Jake loves him and that touches me softly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got home from a night at Jake&rsquo;s <em>(awww&hellip;.😍😘😍)</em> and Tom was eagerly awaiting me to make soufflé for him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/08/20160608.iPhone6SPlus.2537.800.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;doing what i do best, whipping&rsquo; &lsquo;doing what i do best, whipping&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The results ? Of course they&rsquo;re a success ! Jake called me a <a href="https://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef">MasterChef</a> 😉</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/08/20160608.iPhone6SPlus.2539.800.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;MasterChef Danijel beats with love&rsquo; &lsquo;MasterChef Danijel beats with love&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to make food for Jake for the rest of his life. I think my experience with the kitchen and food is enough to bring to our relationship that something that will last our lifetime spent together. I do hope he knows how much I love him. He&rsquo;s the sunshine on a rainy day for me.</p>

<p>Did Tom like the soufflé, naturally of course. Whipped cream and all !</p>
