    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s 27¬∞C and C√¶sar üê∂ is at the back door slobbering all over the glass. He&rsquo;s just been given a new choke-chain this arvo by my mum &lsquo;cos he is a pretty big dog and can&rsquo;t be handled easily without some restraint. I&rsquo;ve decided to bring him down to the local dog park or &ldquo;Pooch Park&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s colloquially known.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3271.5547603029813!2d138.53341811523805!3d-34.9176213803793!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6ab0c5bcdad2c943%3A0xf9a075f26f2c0adc!2sPooch+Park+Tedder+Reserve%2C+LOT+104+Findon+Rd%2C+Flinders+Park+SA+5025!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sau!4v1457858602368" width="450" height="300" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>We get down there after I drove him in the car Ante <em>(the youngest of us 3 boys)</em> gave me, and C√¶sar&rsquo;s üê∂ somehow slobbered all over my windows at this point, so out the car and off we go. A short run around the park and sniff and scratch we go for a walk down under the bridge and along the river front</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/07/bonjour-adelaide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A late start today. I had intended to get up early, go out, have coffee and pastry, peruse around the city soaking in the places I&rsquo;ve not seen since yesteryear and try to find the new changes. I was only here recently in Adelaide for the Healthdirect Christmas break plus a few days, but I was more of a tourist then. I had no intentions to settle down here for a bit and stand still a little while. Now I&rsquo;m back&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Badger <em>(his nickname, I didn&rsquo;t give it to &lsquo;im)</em> has given me a recommendation for coffee this morning. I finally got to the city just after 13:00 and had a walk down memory lane - <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Leigh+St,+Adelaide+SA+5000/@-34.8450789,138.5735432,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ab0cf28363480a7:0xa7fac227eb958f23">Leigh St</a> - where years ago my ex partner Mike and I had a cafe. Actually, we had a cafe on Leigh St, Topham Mall and &hellip; I forgot the connecting street on the other side of Leigh St. I wanna say Bent St, but that doesn&rsquo;t sound right. I guess I could <a href="https://maps.google.com.au">Google</a> it, meh.</p>

<p>So anyway, got into the city, walked down Leigh St, fabulous culture nestled up here hidden away from the dredges of Hindley St. No hookers. Drugs. Habbibi&rsquo;s. Nada! I spotted a little French restaurant that I&rsquo;d like to go back and try this week, people sitting outside laughing and enjoying their Indian meals <em>(were they Halal&nbsp;?)</em> and the vibe was just there. It&rsquo;s almost brewing into a hipster lifestyle.</p>

<p>Stumbling up the little lane with my eyes peeled for everything around me, I found <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/coffee-branch-adelaide">coffee branch</a>, a virtual hole-in-the-wall type shop. You shuffle in, you order, you shuffle out with coffee in hand and some pastry too! I myself got a <a href="http://www.milo.com.au">Milo-flavoured</a> cronut. First thing I noticed was the style. Very hipster! If I closed my eyes and opened them between Newtown and Adelaide I&rsquo;d hardly notice any difference. The price of soy, coconut and almond milk was a little steep <em>(80¬¢ Adelaide vs 50¬¢ Sydney)</em> but well worth it for the overall cost. Friendly staff, amazing decor, profiled origin, chalkboards, a grade of rustic - it was pretty much love at first sight!</p>

<p>I ordered my usual large soy latte, no sugar thnx ‚òïÔ∏è ‚úåüèª</p>

<p>After a few minutes they called out my name and I shuffled out of the store and out the front to the tables to grab a quick snap of my cup. It&rsquo;s totally adorable!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.125225.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="&lsquo;coffee from coffee branch on leigh st&rsquo; &lsquo;coffee branch : 32 leigh st : Adelaide&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Any shop that wants to precede it&rsquo;s reputation will use custom printed cups. Not only does it embed their brand in my mind, it&rsquo;s associative with the quality - let&rsquo;s tuck in!</p>

<p>First sip, clearly burnt my tongue. Why do I do this every time to myself&nbsp;? Seriously I&rsquo;m stupid at the best of times&nbsp;! üòÇ Maybe this is why I&rsquo;m single still&nbsp;? üòè Second sip, yeurk! What is this&nbsp;? It&rsquo;s strong&nbsp;! It&rsquo;s real coffee&nbsp;! I honestly hadn&rsquo;t expected this. I need another sip. <em><em>sips coffee</em></em> Wow&nbsp;! This is amazing&nbsp;!</p>

<p>I can safely say this is a 4&#189; star rating coffee from me to you. I&rsquo;m going to review them later on Yelp! and go back for some more photos of the joint. I&rsquo;m adding this to a list later and will be back to visit sometime again soon. Give it a shot&nbsp;! <em>(excuse the pun)</em></p>

<p>Moving along to <a href="http://rundlemall.com">Rundle Mall</a>, I swooped in to grab the obligatory selfie in the Malls Balls and then grabbed another few pics that just show this timeless piece of artwork. The Rundle Mall Balls are a central icon to the city and I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;d be with out them&nbsp;!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160306.iPhone6Plus.1473.800res.jpg" width="800" height="500" title="&lsquo;Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls&rsquo; &lsquo;Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>One of the greatest things to do in a new city is just walk around and admire the public art. Spouted as the artsy capital of Australia, Melbourne has a plethora of magical art in all forms for the public to admire. It gives a sense of culture to the city. Adelaide, the Festival State, traditionally known for churches and theatre is slowly creeping up with awesome installations popping up all over the place. It&rsquo;s not like thy&rsquo;ve tried to copy any other setups across the globe, but reinvent the wheel with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_art_in_South_Australia">own attractions</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.1744.600res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="&lsquo;artwork in Rundle Mall&rsquo; &lsquo;Rundle Mall D20 bronze artwork&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Not sure what what you&rsquo;d call this, but I dub it the <strong>Rundle Mall D20</strong>. I&rsquo;m not counting the sides, but it was pretty to look at, nice and shiny, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having one in my front yard to look at each morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Get out your glitter, <a href="https://smirnoff.com">vodka</a>, <a href="https://aussiebum.com.au">speedos</a>, tune into <a href="https://sbs.com.au">SBS</a> and log off <a href="https://grindr.com">Grindr</a>, it&rsquo;s that time of year as the Sydney Mardi Gras has arrived! Sporting some of the most fabulous attitudes, fashions and wigs you&rsquo;ve seen this side of the globe it&rsquo;s Christmas for the Gays!</p>

<p>Having been an avid fan of the Mardi Gras for as long as I can remember I was able to work in the Control Room last year being the sole point of contact for the parade floats as they eagerly awaited instructions to step out onto route from Hyde Park. <em>What could go wrong?&ldquo;</em> I asked myself as I volunteered to take the position that everyone else seemed reluctant to raise their hands&hellip;what did go wrong indeed! We survived, and we&rsquo;ll continue to survive for as long as an iota of flair exists - we&rsquo;ll take it and run a marathon.</p>

<p><img src="images/2016/03/20160305.iPhone6Plus.smirnoff_mardi_gras.jpeg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;smirnoff mardi gras 2016 rainbow cup oxford st sydney&rsquo; &lsquo;Smirnoff &amp; Sydney Mardi Gras&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This year I decided to part ways with Sydney before the Mardi Gras parade and step away from everything in silence. I&rsquo;m currently aboard <a href="https://virginaustralia.com.au">Virgin</a> flight VA412 where I hope <em>(yes, hope!)</em> to be greeted by my parents upon landing and brought to my new house.</p>

<p>There will be no celebrations tonight, maybe just coffee with an old friend that time has kept tucked away and my camera in hand. Who ever said it&rsquo;s kosher for a photographer to not have his camera on hand anyway? It&rsquo;s always socially acceptable. üòÄ</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already had my celebrations last night on Oxford St one last time and take this little token with me where I go.</p>

<p>To everyone out and about in Sydney tonight, please stay safe, stay happy, stay fabulous and enjoy this special occasion. Don&rsquo;t forget to tag your posts with <code>#MardiGras</code> so that we can find them later and share in the joy.</p>

<p>And to the man in front of me, if you move your fucking chair one more time I&rsquo;ll karate punch you to the fanny! üò°</p>

<p>On a lighter note, you&rsquo;ll know when you arrive in Adelaide and can see the familiar red signage of <a href="https://cibo.com.au">„Äåcibo„Äç</a> in front of you!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/03/20160305.iPhone6S.180856.800res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="&lsquo;cibo expresso&rsquo; &lsquo;„Äåcibo„Äç espresso Adelaide Airport&rsquo;" >
Amazing coffee, and simple menu. You should try it when <em>(not if)</em> you take a stroll down any of Adelaide&rsquo;s iconic suburbs.</p>
