    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Does the saying go <em>&ldquo;Waiter, there&rsquo;s a spider in my soup&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Ma'am, there&rsquo;s a spider on my cutlery&rdquo;</em> ? I always thought it was the former, no ?</p>

<p>We went this morning for breakfast to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/swedish-tarts-semaphore">Swedish Tarts</a> for cr√™pes, what else ? Well, in short, bad service, a messed up order, spiders on our cutlery, hair on our cr√™pes, aged berries, and coffee served wrong. üò° It wasn&rsquo;t a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2858.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="&lsquo;a spider on my cuterly&rsquo; &lsquo;a spider on my cuterly&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been here before for breakfast once, and Jake was just here not yesterday to pick up coffee for us to have with our homemade breakfast - so what happened today ? I can&rsquo;t say that I was even slightly delighted at the whole experience. Though the food does look amazing, I dare say.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2855.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="&lsquo;mixed berries cr√™pes&rsquo; &lsquo;mixed berries cr√™pes&rsquo;" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2861.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="&lsquo;it looks divine&rsquo; &lsquo;it looks divine&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>So the presentation of these images can save the day. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the finer details of what happened, but we got a refund on one of the cr√™pes <em>(the one with the hair on it)</em> but Jake didn&rsquo;t feel like really eating after that. üòî</p>

<p>So we took a selfie.</p>

<p>What really annoyed me the most about this whole situation was my coffee wasn&rsquo;t served in a takeaway cup and the lady serving me was more interested in telling me about their three store locations so I didn&rsquo;t have to come out all this way just to get it in a takeaway cup&hellip;I still wanted it in a takeaway cup, luv !</p>

<p>To rectify this Jake brought me to a place called <a href="http://theredmillbakehouse.com.au">The Red Mill Caff√©</a> and saved the day. Yay. Great little place. Can&rsquo;t wait to write up my review on <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/">Yelp!</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I met Ralf, Jake&rsquo;s dog since he was a kid. Ralf is 9 years old now :-)</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/11/20160611.ralf2.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="&lsquo;ralf &amp; jake&rsquo; &lsquo;ralf &amp; jake&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I know they belong together because they both have the same attitude and facials. Could you ask for anymore proof that a dog resembles its' master ?</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/11/20160611.ralf4.jpg" width="800" height="450" title="&lsquo;all i know is he loves him&rsquo; &lsquo;all i know is he loves him&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Apart from the kind nature of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar_Pei">Shar Pei</a>, I cannot fathom what makes him just so adorable ! All I know, is Jake loves him and that touches me softly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got home from a night at Jake&rsquo;s <em>(awww&hellip;.üòçüòòüòç)</em> and Tom was eagerly awaiting me to make souffl√© for him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/08/20160608.iPhone6SPlus.2537.800.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;doing what i do best, whipping&rsquo; &lsquo;doing what i do best, whipping&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The results ? Of course they&rsquo;re a success ! Jake called me a <a href="https://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef">MasterChef</a> üòâ</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/08/20160608.iPhone6SPlus.2539.800.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;MasterChef Danijel beats with love&rsquo; &lsquo;MasterChef Danijel beats with love&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to make food for Jake for the rest of his life. I think my experience with the kitchen and food is enough to bring to our relationship that something that will last our lifetime spent together. I do hope he knows how much I love him. He&rsquo;s the sunshine on a rainy day for me.</p>

<p>Did Tom like the souffl√©, naturally of course. Whipped cream and all !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arriving back here in Adelaide on March 3rd this year, one of the first things I did was take to social platform <a href="http://www.grindr.com">Grindr</a> to get a feel from everyone where the best coffee shops were. Yesterday I was talking to Jakey and asked him if he&rsquo;s ever heard of <a href="http://paddyslantern.com.au">Paddy&rsquo;s Lantern</a>. Unfortunately not, and I did leave it to the last two of places to still check out.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember who referred me this venue, but thank you, whoever you are ! It was an absolute delight !</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/1438068476190.png" width="800" height="500" title="&lsquo;paddys lantern&rsquo; &lsquo;paddys lantern&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Nested in the suburban district of Adelaide hidden amongst the old houses at 219 Gilbert Street, this little niche cafe can be found.</p>

<p>The food was amazing, coffee was amazing and to top it off - the service was brilliant !</p>

<p>I picked myself the <em>2 Fried Eggs w/ Spicy Relish on Sourdough Toast</em> and at only $13 this was a total bargain ! You can&rsquo;t go wrong with the perfectly cooked eggs, rustic sourdough, and devilish homemade spicy relish. Mmmmm !</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.091706.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;Eggs, Spicy Relish, Sourdough&rsquo; &lsquo;Eggs, Spicy Relish, Sourdough&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>I also got my standard large size soy latte, no sugar as this is what I really came for. Keeping up standards, I had it served in a takeaway cup. I was a little taken back by the service of being offered my cup still on a saucer, and not just handed to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.091446.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;soy latte takeaway&rsquo; &lsquo;soy latte takeaway&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The print on the cups is faded, but even so it&rsquo;s still so cute ! üòä I can&rsquo;t delay my observations of a full bodied flavour with amazing texture steamed perfectly and no burning with a lasting aroma - wow ! This has to be <em>the</em> coffee in Adelaide. They deserve the 4&frac12; stars awarded to them on <a href="http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/paddys-lantern-adelaide">Yelp!</a> too !</p>

<p><img src="/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.093056.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="&lsquo;second coffee to go thnx&rsquo; &lsquo;second coffee to go thnx&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the area and you want amazing breakfast, please head on down there, bring your partner, work colleagues or a friend and enjoy the simplicity of the atmosphere, the warmth of the service, the spectacular tastes of the products and most importantly - experience it for yourself !</p>
