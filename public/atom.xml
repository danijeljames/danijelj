    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Simply looking down, it&rsquo;s a shopping trolley. With few ingredients. Ricotta, cheese, pasta, broccolini, bread crumbs, milk, celery, and a few other things. It&rsquo;s really so simple, but is it? Can you see deeper into this image?</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/08/17/IMG_4891.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="can you see deeper?" alt="can you see deeper?"></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s our shopping trolley. It&rsquo;s out life. If I told you this is only something simple, it&rsquo;s this moment, that we are here in the name of love, would you see deeper? It&rsquo;s just today. It&rsquo;s just this moment. We&rsquo;re doing our shopping, together. Ever seen your parents shopping together? Or young couples who&rsquo;ve maybe just started their life together? Or how about and old couple with more wrinkles than you can count on your fingers and toes?</p>

<p>I present to you here, one of my most favourable photos from the time we&rsquo;ve spent together. Here and now, today, we are shopping for our groceries - together. We&rsquo;ve decided on meals for a week ahead, convened, agreed, argued, and resolved. Then moved forward.</p>

<p>The act of grocery shopping in itself is quite simple. It&rsquo;s no more than an action of survival at the base of it all. Nothing more, nothing less. An action to plan out a survival plan to nourish our bodies so we can seemingly pass through another period of time. Weekly, monthly, fortnightly? How often do you shop? Do you shop? Are you shopping for yourself, your partner, your family, your friend? Anyone at all?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re about to embark on an adventure between the two of us as we move through another period of transition. Bringing the aspect of weekly meals from separation into a single unified action. Sometimes I cook, sometimes Jake cooks.</p>

<p>Did I write about earlier my blue recipie book? Maybe not. I don&rsquo;t remember all the articles in this blog and what I spoke out from time to time, so I can forget where I&rsquo;m up to!</p>

<p>TL;DR - When I decided Jake was the person I&rsquo;d be spending the rest of my life with, I went out and bought a blue feint lined Moleskin book. Here was to be the recipes that celebrated the history of our life together. From all my experience so far, I had the tools I needed to bring joy to Jake&rsquo;s life through food. Sometimes I&rsquo;m wondering what I&rsquo;m really good at. Is it just making breakfast in bed with a kiss on his forehead? Or is it the warm chicken and sweet corn soup <em>(with special ingredients he would kill me if he found out were in there)</em> when Jake isn&rsquo;t feeling well, so he gets better soon? I don&rsquo;t know. I just know that for many years I&rsquo;ve never fully embraced the kitchen, whether it was a lack of interest or a lack of ambition - but now I feel home is in the kitchen when I know that I&rsquo;ll be making us a meal to share.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t bake. That is solely Jake&rsquo;s forte. My baking skills are limited to setting the fire alarm off and everyone needing to evacuate the building.</p>

<p>The next time you go grocery shopping, stop for a moment and look into your basket, trolley, bag - whatever! Look at it, and see where you really are in life, where you&rsquo;re going, and what you&rsquo;re doing. Don&rsquo;t miss the small things because they are parts of a much greater image.</p>

<p>A jigsaw cannot be complete if you miss 1 piece.</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/07/31/303-by-the-sea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, scrolling through Yelp! looking for a new place to go eat at and came across the venue <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/303-by-the-sea-henley-beach">303 By The Sea</a>. We&rsquo;ve been there already but had to sit outside because of my indecisiveness. So now we&rsquo;re back and we got a nice table at the back of the room.</p>

<p>The lines are long, it&rsquo;s loud, people are sighing, you&rsquo;re really waiting a while to get served - but who can question the quality of the food being served!? It looks amazing.</p>

<p>Jake wanted a hashbrown, eggs, mushrooms and bacon - just simple. Well, apparently not. After discovering the hashbrowns are a meal unto themselves and can&rsquo;t be served with the condiments I asked for, the chef came over and disagreed with my request. As I asked her, I don&rsquo;t mind how much this is going to cost me - find a suitable price and let me have what I want.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/07/31/IMG_4497.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="waiting impatiently" alt="waiting impatiently"></p>

<p>It took them a while to get his food out to us. I really was quite impressed with the quality of my food, but I can&rsquo;t really rave about the experience as a whole. We took to Facebook to make comments about the quality of the experience and endured a tirade from the Madam Chef on Facebook. Sheesh! I don&rsquo;t know what the problem was. Maybe she was having a bad day?</p>

<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a great place, but I think it&rsquo;ll be some time before we come back here. Maybe in the summertime instead?</p>

    <updated>2016-07-07T11:35:04+09:30</updated>
    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/07/07/food-football-fun</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So who would have ever thought that I&rsquo;d be intersted in sport? Not me, that&rsquo;s for sure. It&rsquo;s Friday and Jake&rsquo;s organised something for us to do. What exactly I&rsquo;m not sure. But why would I care? As long as I&rsquo;m spending time with him I just know that my life is the greatest achievement.</p>

<p>We ended up first at a restaurant on North Tce that I hadn&rsquo;t been to, but eyeing off since I got back to Adelaide. Argentinian influenced steak house/tapas bar. Service was a bit below par, but the waitress lightened up the mood. Food was incredibly juicy and I really liked it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/la-boca-bar-and-grill-adelaide">La Boca</a> is generally pretty busy from what I&rsquo;ve observed each time I&rsquo;ve been past so it was great to finally get in here and have a look at the place.</p>

<p>Heading down to the football we grabbed a drink each and went down to our favourite spot. It&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve come to the football with Jake and I feel like he&rsquo;s opened my eyes to appreciate the simpler things in life I&rsquo;ve learned to reject. Maybe I should pick a team and get a season pass for the two of us? That would make a nice surprise and we&rsquo;ll finally start to accumulate elements in our life which belong to nobody else but ourselves.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/07/07/IMG_3770.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="standing on the hill" alt="standing on the hill"></p>

<p>After the football match we went down to the carpark to find some Pokémon to build up our Pokédex more. Bored with this we went on to the Alpine Winter Village on North Tce. What do we see apart from crap food and llamas? Ice arena! Fuck yes!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/07/07/IMG_3798.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="boys on the ice" alt="boys on the ice"></p>

<p>Poor Jake fell over totally whilst I was busy filming a selfie video. He fell just out of the frame and I had tears literally flowing freely as I keeled over to laugh instead of going over to help him. What kind of a boyfriend am I? The worst kind!</p>

<p>Before the night was over we stopped in at a little photo booth van to get 4 black and white selfies - the old style selfie - in a film strip. I love this photo so much of us. I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to do something cool and fun like this all my life and secretly always been jealous of the people that keep images like this in their wallet. Thank you Jake. This was an amazing night. You&rsquo;re the greatest.</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/06/26/jake-take-me-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How did the day start? Perfect. I went to get Jake to start the day. 😍</p>

<p>First we went to the HMAS Adelaide Open Day.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/26/DJW.20160626.iPhone6SPlus.3303.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="HMAS Adelaide" alt="HMAS Adelaide"></p>

<p>Afterwards Jake and I were supposed to go on the Dolphin Cruise <em>(he&rsquo;s so sneaky, he organised this without telling me!)</em> but we missed that because the tour of the ship took longer than it was supposed to. How did I ever deserve this man? What did I do? I don&rsquo;t know. All I know, is this is the perfect life.</p>

<p>We thought about it, and I suggested Hahndorf. On the way, we went to a winery to do a cheese and wine testing. I&rsquo;ve never done this before! So why not?</p>

<p>Jake brought me to Shaw &amp; Smith cellar door where we took a flight. A wine flight! Did you know that? Tell me I&rsquo;m not the only silly person who doesn&rsquo;t know these things? A wine flight!? Ha! What a cute name. So we took a trip together.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/26/DJW.20160626.iPhone6SPlus.3347.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Wine Flight" alt="Wine Flight"></p>

<p>After this wonderful matching we headed into Hahndorf, stopped at a market, then across the road to the candy shop and then back here.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/26/DJW.20160626.iPhone6SPlus.3355.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="I want all the candy" alt="I want all the candy"></p>

<p>Unfortunately after dinner I had to bring Jake home. He wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to sleep at my place because the bed is quite hard. 😔</p>

<blockquote><p>Jake, take me home&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, I can hardly hold back my anticipation. There is going to be a day in the future, when I can fall over drunk and turn to this man, and say to him, <em>&ldquo;Jake, take me home&rdquo;</em> and we&rsquo;ll be going back to the same place that we both share together. Our house. Our home. And we&rsquo;ll have a cute dog.</p>

<p>Hopefully the lady next door won&rsquo;t grow ugly tulips so I don&rsquo;t have to complain! 😂</p>

<blockquote><p>11:11, make a wish&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s just passed 11:11 as I&rsquo;m writing this, so make a wish. ✨</p>

<p>My wish, is simple. For Jake &amp; Danijel <code>#jakeanddanijel</code> to enjoy a long and wonderful life full of laughter, smiles and wonderful memories.</p>

<p>Goodnight!</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/06/20/spicy-chiken-chipotle-white-pumpkin-fettuccini</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever had the idea to fusion two dishes together and hope it go well? I did. And it worked! 🙌🏻</p>

<p>Taking the idea of carbonara being a white-sauced bacon dish and pumpkin fetta pasta, I thought to myself, why can&rsquo;t I make this into two new dishes? It can&rsquo;t be that hard, can it?</p>

<p>First things first, Jake likes spicy food. Not spicy enough to burn a new hole in your arse, but something nice. 🌶🌶🌶😋 Why not try to make the base of both these dishes into something new and use some of my chipotle sauce to bring it together? It&rsquo;s worth a shot! 🔫</p>

<p>Pumpkin in a pasta dish need to be firm, so I took some kent and butternut pumpkins and roasted them with olive oil, thyme, cracked pepper and salt crystals and ground salt for ~45mins @ 180°C <em>(fan forced)</em> and then left them in there until I was ready. I did turn them about half way through to make sure they baked evenly.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3126.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="roast pumpkin cubes" alt="roast pumpkin cubes"></p>

<p>On to the main dish. Starting with onion, I sweated it until it became translucent and added chilli then chicken and a glob of my chipotle sauce. It needed to mix around and get juicy on a low temperature to bind the flavours. Added some more salt.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3125.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="create the chicken base" alt="create the chicken base"></p>

<p>Why all the salt? Well, saw this crazy Korean woman <em>(Maangchi)</em> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/?gl=AU&amp;hl=en-GB">YouTube</a> when she started with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNKal3PI_Q">Korean style iced coffee - Naeng-keopi: 냉커피</a> and then followed her around and saw lots of videos that use salt - a lot of salt! I&rsquo;m surprised she didn&rsquo;t put salt in her iced coffee! 😂</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/20/20160620.Maangchi.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="Maangchi" alt="Maanghi"></p>

<p>Anyway, back to the dish at hand. 😁</p>

<p>So then you skin and chop up some mushrooms, fry for a bit on low heat, add chopped bacon, fry some more, add &frac12; cup of white wine <em>(something cheap will do)</em>, add &frac12; cup of chicken or vegetable stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins. Add the chicken stuff to this, including all the juices and add about &frac12; cup of cream and simmer for 10 mins.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3137.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="sauce is ready" alt="sauce is ready"></p>

<p>Right before serving, add the pumpkin we made earlier and some baby spinach and stir until the spinach is wilted. Get your pasta ready and put it on the bowls, scoop some sauce on top and serve!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3140.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="perfect dish" alt="perfect dish"></p>

<p>I get called a <code>#masterchef</code> by Jake all the time. Half of me believes because he loves me so much, the other half because of the taste I procure to his palate!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/20/DJW.20160620.iPhone6SPlus.3144.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="bowls are clean" alt="bowls are clean"></p>

<p>A clean bowl is a perfect dish ✌️</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/06/13/a-spider-on-my-cutlery</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Does the saying go <em>&ldquo;Waiter, there&rsquo;s a spider in my soup&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;Ma'am, there&rsquo;s a spider on my cutlery&rdquo;</em>? I always thought it was the former, no ?</p>

<p>We went this morning for breakfast to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/swedish-tarts-semaphore">Swedish Tarts</a> for crêpes, what else? Well, in short, bad service, a messed up order, spiders on our cutlery, hair on our crêpes, aged berries, and coffee served wrong. 😡 It wasn&rsquo;t a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2858.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="a spider on my cuterly" alt="a spider on my cuterly"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been here before for breakfast once, and Jake was just here not yesterday to pick up coffee for us to have with our homemade breakfast - so what happened today? I can&rsquo;t say that I was even slightly delighted at the whole experience. Though the food does look amazing, I dare say.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2855.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="mixed berries crêpes" alt="mixed berries crêpes"></p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2857.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="sugar lemon crêpes" alt="sugar lemon crêpes"></p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2861.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="it looks divine" alt="it looks divine"></p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2863.800res.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="the face when you see a spider" alt="the face when you see a spider"></p>

<p>So the presentation of these images can save the day. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the finer details of what happened, but we got a refund on one of the crêpes <em>(the one with the hair on it)</em> but Jake didn&rsquo;t feel like really eating after that. 😔</p>

<p>So we took a selfie.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/13/DJW.20160613.iPhone6SPlus.2864.800res.jpg" width="800" height="600" title="Jake & Danijel" alt="Jake & Danijel"></p>

<p>What really annoyed me the most about this whole situation was my coffee wasn&rsquo;t served in a takeaway cup and the lady serving me was more interested in telling me about their three store locations so I didn&rsquo;t have to come out all this way just to get it in a takeaway cup&hellip;I still wanted it in a takeaway cup, luv!</p>

<p>To rectify this Jake brought me to a place called <a href="http://theredmillbakehouse.com.au">The Red Mill Caffé</a> and saved the day. Yay. Great little place. Can&rsquo;t wait to write up my review on <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/">Yelp!</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I met Ralf, Jake&rsquo;s dog since he was a kid. Ralf is 9 years old now :-)</p>

<p>I know they belong together because they both have the same attitude and facials. Could you ask for anymore proof that a dog resembles its' master?</p>

<p>Apart from the kind nature of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar_Pei">Shar Pei</a>, I cannot fathom what makes him just so adorable! All I know, is Jake loves him and that touches me softly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just got home from a night at Jake&rsquo;s <em>(awww&hellip;.😍😘😍)</em> and Tom was eagerly awaiting me to make soufflé for him.</p>

<p>The results? Of course they&rsquo;re a success! Jake called me a <a href="https://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef">MasterChef</a> 😉</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/08/20160608.iPhone6SPlus.2539.800.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="MasterChef Danijel beats with love" alt="MasterChef Danijel beats with love"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to make food for Jake for the rest of his life. I think my experience with the kitchen and food is enough to bring to our relationship that something that will last our lifetime spent together. I do hope he knows how much I love him. He&rsquo;s the sunshine on a rainy day for me.</p>

<p>Did Tom like the soufflé, naturally of course. Whipped cream and all!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arriving back here in Adelaide on March 3rd this year, one of the first things I did was take to social platform <a href="http://www.grindr.com">Grindr</a> to get a feel from everyone where the best coffee shops were. Yesterday I was talking to Jakey and asked him if he&rsquo;s ever heard of <a href="http://paddyslantern.com.au">Paddy&rsquo;s Lantern</a>. Unfortunately not, and I did leave it to the last two of places to still check out.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember who referred me this venue, but thank you, whoever you are! It was an absolute delight !</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/02/1438068476190.png" width="800" height="500" title="paddys lantern" alt="paddys lantern"></p>

<p>Nested in the suburban district of Adelaide hidden amongst the old houses at 219 Gilbert Street, this little niche cafe can be found.</p>

<p>The food was amazing, coffee was amazing and to top it off - the service was brilliant!</p>

<p>I picked myself the <em>2 Fried Eggs w/ Spicy Relish on Sourdough Toast</em> and at only $13 this was a total bargain! You can&rsquo;t go wrong with the perfectly cooked eggs, rustic sourdough, and devilish homemade spicy relish. Mmmmm !</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.091706.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="Eggs, Spicy Relish, Sourdough" alt="Eggs, Spicy Relish, Sourdough"></p>

<p>I also got my standard large size soy latte, no sugar as this is what I really came for. Keeping up standards, I had it served in a takeaway cup. I was a little taken back by the service of being offered my cup still on a saucer, and not just handed to me.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/02/20160602.iPhone6SPlus.091446.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="soy latte takeaway" alt="soy latte takeaway"></p>

<p>The print on the cups is faded, but even so it&rsquo;s still so cute! 😊 I can&rsquo;t delay my observations of a full bodied flavour with amazing texture steamed perfectly and no burning with a lasting aroma - wow ! This has to be <em>the</em> coffee in Adelaide. They deserve the 4&frac12; stars awarded to them on <a href="http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/paddys-lantern-adelaide">Yelp!</a> too !</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the area and you want amazing breakfast, please head on down there, bring your partner, work colleagues or a friend and enjoy the simplicity of the atmosphere, the warmth of the service, the spectacular tastes of the products and most importantly - experience it for yourself!</p>

    <updated>2016-06-01T10:40:35+09:30</updated>
    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/06/01/car-wash-and-lamb-dinner</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh no, what&rsquo;s he done? Jake&rsquo;s given me his car for the day!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/01/20160601.iPhone6SPlus.095132.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="uh oh spaghetti-o" alt="uh oh spaghetti-o"></p>

<p>This poor man is always tired, stressed or sleeping. What do you think I&rsquo;m gonna do today? That&rsquo;s easy. I&rsquo;m gonna wash his car for him and surprise him at the end of the day 😄</p>

<p>I went to the RepCo or whatever it&rsquo;s called near my house and got some supplies. When I was young I had a weekend job that saw me travelling to car yards each Saturday morning and I&rsquo;d wash the cars. It wasn&rsquo;t how many cars were washed per hour, it was here&rsquo;s $150, go was as many cars as you can per hour for 3 hours. Not bad when you&rsquo;re 14!</p>

<p>Men like pink, right? Well, I&rsquo;m a man and I&rsquo;m not afraid of pink, and I love the bubblegum smell of the detergent I picked for this job too!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/01/20160601.iPhone6SPlus.110357.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="sweet like bubblegum" alt="sweet like bubblegum"></p>

<p>So how do I go with this job? Fantastic darling, absolutely fantastic. I remember Jake saying to me that the one time he goes to wash his car, and so does the whole of Adelaide. LOL This is going to be perfect opportunity for me to do something for him, and him alone. It&rsquo;s not a present. It&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve made. It&rsquo;s something I can do for the sake of doing it for him because this is what real love is about. It&rsquo;s what you can do for that person to make their life a little better. Call it a miracle, if you will, I try to perform a miracle each day for Jake. That&rsquo;s always on my agenda.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/01/20160601.iPhone6SPlus.113541.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="wash wash wash" alt="wash wash wash"></p>

<p>To say that washing his car was worth it would be an understatement. It saved Jake so much time and effort; and now it&rsquo;s one less thing that he can worry about.</p>

<p>But he&rsquo;s coming over for dinner tonight, <em>yeah, it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re never getting married or anything, so may as well show him that I can cook, and well sic.,</em> so what do I make him? I know&hellip;his favourite dish - Lamb! Best part is, I&rsquo;ve not cooked lamb for anyone &hellip; EVER !</p>

<p>Obviously it was good when you see someone staring on at their food wanting do devour it, &lsquo;eh?</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/06/01/20160601.iPhone6SPlus.2160.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="can i have my lamb now?" alt="can i have my lamb now?"></p>

<p>I think our collaborative effort to make dinner, <em>Jake made the veggies, I made the sauce just for his palate and the lamb to my own style,</em> and it came out pretty swish if you ask me!</p>

<p>Would you say that was a great dinner Jake? Oh what&rsquo;s that ? 10/10 ? Lee Lin Chin would be proud! 5 Stars !</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while someone will come through your life and the whole game will change.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough in my life that I&rsquo;ve always been the one to walk away and not regret the choice to do so. I&rsquo;m not a cold-hearted person or without any emotions, rather they&rsquo;re difficult to be interpreted by other people and it&rsquo;s without regret that I&rsquo;ve not come across someone that&rsquo;s going to make me bring these to the surface.</p>

<p>Recently I wrote about someone special that came into my life but I haven&rsquo;t been able to get the whole story down pat and I think it&rsquo;s time I put these memories into words so I don&rsquo;t forget who they were, even if I don&rsquo;t see them again. 😔</p>

<p>Before I left Sydney, I spoke a colleague of mine <em>(from a different department)</em> named Gillian who told me I need to start writing my memories down and keeping them so that one day I can look back on it all and reflect. It&rsquo;s funny that I was only thinking of Gillian the other day when she wrote to me via email today to enquire how I was. Thank you Gillian 😊 I haven&rsquo;t forgotten you and I have thought about you a few times since leaving Sydney. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re doing well ✌️</p>

<p>So back to my story - <em>I get easily side-tracked</em> - we met and we went from there. First meeting under the <a href="https://c8.staticflickr.com/4/3633/3366493095_d2d02753ed_b.jpg">Semaphore Clock Tower</a> we went for a walk down the jetty and then along the foreshore and eventually landed ourselves a table at a local cafe. From there we went to <a href="http://www.kmart.com.au">K-Mart</a> and picked out some bedsheets for him and then back to each other&rsquo;s respective home.</p>

<p>I saw him again, and again, and again! What was it that drew me to this person above anyone else that I&rsquo;ve met in my life? Something twinged inside me and for a long time I&rsquo;ve never been able to put my thumb on it. All I knew was this was good, and I was happy. I started to open up emotionally and discovered that I could evolve in ways I didn&rsquo;t know existed within the parameters of my soul.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spoken many times in my life about the three aspects that make you human. They are your body, your mind, and your soul. But what about the heart? Do I try to confuse everyone by saying the soul is the heart ? No. Never. The heart is the fourth aspect of being human, and this is created when two people meet for the first time.</p>

<p>How so, I hear you ask? Well, let me explain.</p>

<p>The heart is created the first time two people come together. It&rsquo;s an emotional connection. When you care about someone, the distance between the two of you is the stretch of that connection and that&rsquo;s where the heart is physically born. If you lived on this earth as the only person in existence you would never know the aspect of the heart as it cannot be created by yourself. It&rsquo;s shared from the components the two of you put into the middle.</p>

<p>If you believe with all your heart that you belong with that person, then you will reside there for an eternity of time and I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says, they&rsquo;ll never forget you. Even after the last goodbye.</p>

<blockquote><p>Promise you won’t forget me, ever. Not even when I’m a hundred.</p></blockquote>

<p>I won&rsquo;t even need to ask this person to not forget me if I&rsquo;ve created the heart with them. Not even when I&rsquo;m a hundred, because I&rsquo;ll be with them forever. I entrust my heart to this person and know that even if I die alone I will not be forgotten as the memories will carry on with them. ☺️</p>

<p>So as time goes on, we start to tread waters and I&rsquo;m finding myself falling in the best possible way - without boundaries. Soon before long I found myself thinking about them every day and occupying a major percentage of where this amazing ecstacy in my life comes from.</p>

<p>Though there wouldn&rsquo;t be a story if there wasn&rsquo;t at least one broken heart, a moment of silence and a phoenix to rise from the fire.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/05/18/20160518.lucky_to_say_goodbye.jpg" width="533" height="800" title="something that makes saying goodbye so hard" alt="something that makes saying goodbye so hard"></p>

<p>Have you ever felt that it was hard to say goodbye? Have you ever been so lucky ?</p>

<p>I remember the last time I saw my grandfather in hospital and knew this would be the last time I ever got to see him alive. Did I feel sad? No. Not really. Call me cold-hearted. I don&rsquo;t care. It&rsquo;s a fact.</p>

<p>I celebrated my love for him as my mentor when growing up and showing me the endurance of love through the years that I had with him. See, the situation is a little more tangled that I let you know. So I&rsquo;ll explain. My grandmother had a memory problem and creating short-term and keeping long-term memories was a problem. My memories of my grandparents has always been my grandfather staying close to her, reminding her where she is, and what she&rsquo;s doing. He kept a close eye on her so she didn&rsquo;t get lost and always was safe and sound. It sounds like he was controlling, but not really. He refused to put her in a nursing home. That was his wife who he&rsquo;d spent all those years of marriage with and he wanted to keep her close to him now in the time of her need. Can anyone else say they&rsquo;ve seen this kind of dedication? I hope so!</p>

<p>After my grandmother passed away I kind of remember a shift in my grandfather&rsquo;s emotions, he let go. That was his life that had passed away from his hands. Sure, he had three daughters, one of which is <a href="https://danijelj.com/blog/2016/05/08/happy-mothers-day/">my mother</a> but at some point his heart broke. The only part of his heart that still existed was the memories he shared and created with the heart that was born between the two of them. They&rsquo;re names are Denise and Thelma. I share part of my name with my grandfather. The James component. So regardless of whether I had a heart with him or not, I share something with him eternally. 😁</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have to say goodbye to my grandfather, or my grandmother. They live eternally with me in my memories. I never let them go, they stay with me every day.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://danijelj.com/blog/2016/05/03/i-will-never-stop-fighting-for-love/">previous post</a>, I mentioned that a friend said to me that I&rsquo;m never truly in love with someone and I agree. But that was before I met this person. I could say their name, but at this point in time I need to let them settle on how things have come about and I need to take this time to reflect too.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. Not at all. It&rsquo;s just that we&rsquo;ve got to take some time to evaluate the situation at hand.</p>

<p>Myself, I am an emotionally strong person. I&rsquo;ve spent years and years learning how to connect with my emotions and trying to understand them better. I&rsquo;m an Aries. And yes I do believe firmly in the science of astrology. It&rsquo;s not verbatim, I can&rsquo;t prove this is right or wrong. Just accept it, that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p>In the past you could say I was a violent person. I would lash out and let my emotions rule and control my behaviour without much room for a buffer. Then I said something to someone one day in a fit of anger and the feeling that came over me after letting those words go showed me that you truly can stab someone <em>(no pun intended)</em> with just words and words alone. I had literally put a knife deep into their soul and cut them. Was I sorry for what I said? No. And I&rsquo;m still not. I don&rsquo;t like her. She&rsquo;s a bitch. What I took away from that was that it&rsquo;s now time to sit back, see what I&rsquo;m doing, what I&rsquo;ve done, and look to where I want to be. So, I now control my anger. I don&rsquo;t lash out with horrible words or go break plates or drive my car through shop windows - yes that&rsquo;s a true story and I&rsquo;ll write about it one day too.</p>

<p>For many years I&rsquo;ve had the pent up emotion inside of me that&rsquo;s been yearning to find a way to express. That emotion can ignite the hearts of stars across the night sky. Fuse rubies in the hearts of planets. Dry entire oceans across the lands. Drench the forests in torrents of waters. There is no limit to this emotion.</p>

<p>It found an outlet. The very person that I&rsquo;ve been talking about this whole time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the single most truest emotion of all my repository of emotions and it comes without end to expression once we travel it&rsquo;s road.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t been able to control this emotion. It comes out so naturally, and because it does this and being so strong, it&rsquo;s like a tidal force against a single flower a world with an unchanging night sky, an endless white desert across the ground. Nothing exists here except this lone flower.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/05/18/20160518.endlesswhitesands.png" width="800" height="565" title="endless white sands" alt="endless white sands"></p>

<blockquote><p>I didn&rsquo;t pull back, I was so enraptured. This is my downfall.</p></blockquote>

<p>My downfall was that I didn&rsquo;t heed the notice given to me and pull back a little bit. This lone flower stands by itself in the endless desert and it sees no stars or sun. Just an unchanging foreverness. It&rsquo;s always been like this.</p>

<p>So now the flower has suffocated under the tsunami of emotions and I&rsquo;m left in a place where I can only sit back to contemplate.</p>

<p>After a reflection on the words said to me tonight, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion of two things.</p>

<p>The first being that this person might be scared of love and never experienced it properly before and they don&rsquo;t know what to do with these feelings. I should have recognised this and let them time to process this and take it slowly and thoughtfully. Yes, I&rsquo;m well established in my principles and behaviours. I don&rsquo;t like to admit this, but I&rsquo;m really not perfect. I&rsquo;d like you to believe I was and write whole books on how to be a respectable person.</p>

<blockquote><p>But who am I to instruct you? I&rsquo;m not!</p></blockquote>

<p>The second being this person seems to think the <em>ONLY</em> reason I stay in Adelaide is because of them and I hate it here.</p>

<p>I take these two main instruments and carve them into two lessons for myself.</p>

<h3>The First Lesson</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve reached the peak of my evolution. But didn&rsquo;t I say that to myself when I was 23 too? Didn&rsquo;t I stand there in front of a whole group of people saying something stupid like <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing left for me to learn in this world. I&rsquo;ve learned all there is to know.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Fucking hell I was a stupid young man. Who ever said there&rsquo;s nothing left to learn? Well, obviously me. Even just tonight I said something just as selfish and stupid.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve reached the peak of my evolution, and there&rsquo;s nothing left to aspire to.</p></blockquote>

<p>FUCK! NO !</p>

<p>No on so many levels. Just no. Why? Because I said that just at the beginning of this year and then what ? Well, along came this person, and I learned something totally new. Emotions. Ways of being. Personality traits. Behaviours. Laughter. Sadness. Anticipation. So many things I can&rsquo;t even being to process them all.</p>

<h3>The Second Lesson</h3>

<p>Referring to an email I send to Gillian earlier today whilst waiting out the front of his work to finish, I&rsquo;ll pull the most quintessential quote out into the open&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;then I remember that this is my home&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. Adelaide is my home. I got off that plane and I made a decision to live here and make my life. I think I&rsquo;ve been so bored without work that I&rsquo;m going crazy in my own mind a little bit and need something to focus on. Because of that I&rsquo;ve said some really stupid thoughts which have been stirring around in my mind. I&rsquo;ve been hating on Adelaide and that has created an unnecessary pressure on this person and can it be possible that they now feel like I&rsquo;m only here because of them and I want to leave?</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been so caught up being emotionally moved by him that I forgot to expose him to my other temperaments.</p></blockquote>

<p>I forgot to show him where my true love lies in Adelaide. The rhythm and the beat of the people. Who knew me in Sydney? Did you ? Maybe you did and maybe you didn&rsquo;t. What was that one thing I always said I loved about Australia ? It was Adelaide and her people.</p>

<p>This person deserved to see my other temperaments and unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t reign back on the prime emotion and look where it&rsquo;s led us now.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many times I heard or read the words <em>&ldquo;you scare me&rdquo;</em>. Why was I created so scientifically intelligent that I&rsquo;m so readily and easily able to overlook the most simple things in life - what is right before me. I&rsquo;m always in the dark.</p>

<p>So now, we&rsquo;re at a point where I&rsquo;ve listened, learned, and will continue to learn. I&rsquo;ve said my true representation of what I want. I want them to come back.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s never been a time that I was scared until now. Only a few words ushered have given me a whole new perspective. They&rsquo;re going to be quiet for a while. That&rsquo;s OK. I can deal with that. I want them to take what they need from this. It&rsquo;s the part that followed that scared me. 💀</p>

<blockquote><p>I may not come back fyi</p></blockquote>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;ve come to a point with this person where I know there is a possibility that maybe they might not come back, and all I can say is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard.</p></blockquote>

<p>So, did I start this article with the right words? Clearly not. Let me try that again.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been UNLUCKY enough in my life that I&rsquo;ve always been the one to walk away and not regret the choice to do so.</p></blockquote>

<h3>A Final Note</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://banksy.co.uk">Banksy</a> image referred to as <em>&ldquo;Girl With Balloon&rdquo;</em> that represents letting go of what makes you sad. I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with this sentiment.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/05/18/20160518.banksy-girl-with-balloon.jpg" width="600" height="675" title="never give up" alt="never give up"></p>

<p>To me this image is a sole representation of never giving up. The little girl represents me and the balloon him. I&rsquo;m reaching out, but I&rsquo;m not gonna run yet. The balloon will hover there and when it&rsquo;s ready it will go whichever way it wants. If it floats back towards me, I&rsquo;m going to hold it by the thread between my fingers and slowly hold the thread with more fingers the closer the balloon is ready to come. If ever. 😊</p>
