    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gentlemen, may I warn you that when you live by yourself, this is what breakfast will look like if your parents don&rsquo;t teach you to cook for yourself, or you meet an honest husband/wife that you learn to make breakfast for them too. Why ? Because you love them !</p>

<p>Finally install the latest version using <code>PIP</code> again:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

I&rsquo;ve decided to bring him down to the local dog park or &ldquo;Pooch Park&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s colloquially known.</p>

<p>We get down there after I drove him in the car Ante <em>(the youngest of us 3 boys)</em> gave me, and C√¶sar&rsquo;s üê∂ somehow slobbered all over my windows at this point, so out the car and off we go. A short run around the park and sniff and scratch we go for a walk down under the bridge and along the river front</p>

    <updated>2016-03-07T13:39:59+10:30</updated>
    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/07/bonjour-adelaide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A late start today. I had intended to get up early, go out, have coffee and pastry, peruse around the city soaking in the places I&rsquo;ve not seen since yesteryear and try to find the new changes. I was only here recently in Adelaide for the Healthdirect Christmas break plus a few days, but I was more of a tourist then. I had no intentions to settle down here for a bit and stand still a little while. Now I&rsquo;m back&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Badger <em>(his nickname, I didn&rsquo;t give it to &lsquo;im)</em> has given me a recommendation for coffee this morning. I finally got to the city just after 13:00 and had a walk down memory lane - <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Leigh+St,+Adelaide+SA+5000/@-34.8450789,138.5735432,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ab0cf28363480a7:0xa7fac227eb958f23">Leigh St</a> - where years ago my ex partner Mike and I had a cafe. Actually, we had a cafe on Leigh St, Topham Mall and &hellip; I forgot the connecting street on the other side of Leigh St. I wanna say Bent St, but that doesn&rsquo;t sound right. I guess I could <a href="https://maps.google.com.au">Google</a> it, meh.</p>

<p>So anyway, got into the city, walked down Leigh St, fabulous culture nestled up here hidden away from the dredges of Hindley St. No hookers. Drugs. Habbibi&rsquo;s. Nada! I spotted a little French restaurant that I&rsquo;d like to go back and try this week, people sitting outside laughing and enjoying their Indian meals <em>(were they Halal&nbsp;?)</em> and the vibe was just there. It&rsquo;s almost brewing into a hipster lifestyle.</p>

<p>Stumbling up the little lane with my eyes peeled for everything around me, I found <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/coffee-branch-adelaide">coffee branch</a>, a virtual hole-in-the-wall type shop. You shuffle in, you order, you shuffle out with coffee in hand and some pastry too! I myself got a <a href="http://www.milo.com.au">Milo-flavoured</a> cronut. First thing I noticed was the style. Very hipster! If I closed my eyes and opened them between Newtown and Adelaide I&rsquo;d hardly notice any difference. The price of soy, coconut and almond milk was a little steep <em>(80¬¢ Adelaide vs 50¬¢ Sydney)</em> but well worth it for the overall cost. Friendly staff, amazing decor, profiled origin, chalkboards, a grade of rustic - it was pretty much love at first sight!</p>

<p>I ordered my usual large soy latte, no sugar thnx ‚òïÔ∏è ‚úåüèª</p>

<p>After a few minutes they called out my name and I shuffled out of the store and out the front to the tables to grab a quick snap of my cup. It&rsquo;s totally adorable!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.125225.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="coffee from coffee branch on leigh st" alt="coffee branch : 32 leigh st : Adelaide"></p>

<p>Any shop that wants to precede it&rsquo;s reputation will use custom printed cups. Not only does it embed their brand in my mind, it&rsquo;s associative with the quality - let&rsquo;s tuck in!</p>

<p>First sip, clearly burnt my tongue. Why do I do this every time to myself&nbsp;? Seriously I&rsquo;m stupid at the best of times&nbsp;! üòÇ Maybe this is why I&rsquo;m single still&nbsp;? üòè Second sip, yeurk! What is this&nbsp;? It&rsquo;s strong&nbsp;! It&rsquo;s real coffee&nbsp;! I honestly hadn&rsquo;t expected this. I need another sip. <em><em>sips coffee</em></em> Wow&nbsp;! This is amazing&nbsp;!</p>

<p>I can safely say this is a 4&#189; star rating coffee from me to you. I&rsquo;m going to review them later on Yelp! and go back for some more photos of the joint. I&rsquo;m adding this to a list later and will be back to visit sometime again soon. Give it a shot&nbsp;! <em>(excuse the pun)</em></p>

<p>Moving along to <a href="http://rundlemall.com">Rundle Mall</a>, I swooped in to grab the obligatory selfie in the Malls Balls and then grabbed another few pics that just show this timeless piece of artwork. The Rundle Mall Balls are a central icon to the city and I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;d be with out them&nbsp;!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160306.iPhone6Plus.1473.800res.jpg" width="800" height="500" title="Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls" alt="Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls"></p>

<p>One of the greatest things to do in a new city is just walk around and admire the public art. Spouted as the artsy capital of Australia, Melbourne has a plethora of magical art in all forms for the public to admire. It gives a sense of culture to the city. Adelaide, the Festival State, traditionally known for churches and theatre is slowly creeping up with awesome installations popping up all over the place. It&rsquo;s not like thy&rsquo;ve tried to copy any other setups across the globe, but reinvent the wheel with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_art_in_South_Australia">own attractions</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.1744.600res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="artwork in Rundle Mall" alt="Rundle Mall D20 bronze artwork"></p>

<p>Not sure what what you&rsquo;d call this, but I dub it the <strong>Rundle Mall D20</strong>. I&rsquo;m not counting the sides, but it was pretty to look at, nice and shiny, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having one in my front yard to look at each morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Get out your glitter, <a href="https://smirnoff.com">vodka</a>, <a href="https://aussiebum.com.au">speedos</a>, tune into <a href="https://sbs.com.au">SBS</a> and log off <a href="https://grindr.com">Grindr</a>, it&rsquo;s that time of year as the Sydney Mardi Gras has arrived! Sporting some of the most fabulous attitudes, fashions and wigs you&rsquo;ve seen this side of the globe it&rsquo;s Christmas for the Gays!</p>

<p>Having been an avid fan of the Mardi Gras for as long as I can remember I was able to work in the Control Room last year being the sole point of contact for the parade floats as they eagerly awaited instructions to step out onto route from Hyde Park. <em>What could go wrong?&ldquo;</em> I asked myself as I volunteered to take the position that everyone else seemed reluctant to raise their hands&hellip;what did go wrong indeed! We survived, and we&rsquo;ll continue to survive for as long as an iota of flair exists - we&rsquo;ll take it and run a marathon.</p>

<p><img src="images/2016/03/20160305.iPhone6Plus.smirnoff_mardi_gras.jpeg" width="800" height="800" title="smirnoff mardi gras 2016 rainbow cup oxford st sydney" alt="Smirnoff & Sydney Mardi Gras"></p>

<p>This year I decided to part ways with Sydney before the Mardi Gras parade and step away from everything in silence. I&rsquo;m currently aboard <a href="https://virginaustralia.com.au">Virgin</a> flight VA412 where I hope <em>(yes, hope!)</em> to be greeted by my parents upon landing and brought to my new house.</p>

<p>There will be no celebrations tonight, maybe just coffee with an old friend that time has kept tucked away and my camera in hand. Who ever said it&rsquo;s kosher for a photographer to not have his camera on hand anyway? It&rsquo;s always socially acceptable. üòÄ</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already had my celebrations last night on Oxford St one last time and take this little token with me where I go.</p>

<p>To everyone out and about in Sydney tonight, please stay safe, stay happy, stay fabulous and enjoy this special occasion. Don&rsquo;t forget to tag your posts with <code>#MardiGras</code> so that we can find them later and share in the joy.</p>

<p>And to the man in front of me, if you move your fucking chair one more time I&rsquo;ll karate punch you to the fanny! üò°</p>

<p>On a lighter note, you&rsquo;ll know when you arrive in Adelaide and can see the familiar red signage of <a href="https://cibo.com.au">„Äåcibo„Äç</a> in front of you!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160305.iPhone6S.180856.800res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="cibo expresso" alt="„Äåcibo„Äç espresso Adelaide Airport">
Amazing coffee, and simple menu. You should try it when <em>(not if)</em> you take a stroll down any of Adelaide&rsquo;s iconic suburbs.</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/04/goodbye-healthdirect</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember the first time I was contacted about a position at <a href="https://healthdirect.org.au">Healthdirect Australia</a>. I never applied for the job, I was asked to go to an interview that had been tee&rsquo;d up! Was I being head-hunted for this role or did someone pass my name along as a favour? I never found out and sometimes it&rsquo;s better to not know the whole story anyway!</p>

<p>6 months have passed <em>(a week)</em> since that first time and here we are parting ways. It must be said that Healthdirect and all her employees have been truly monumental in my career development and integral to my development as a person. I cannot express in words how overwhelmed I have been with the reception from the company as I parted ways today. Thank you, everyone!</p>

<p>For the usual send-off, the Corporate IT team will head down and enjoy lunch <i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i> together in honour of the person who&rsquo;s departing or their birthday. We enjoyed a meal at <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/misschu-sydney">MissChu</a>, one of my favourite Vietnamese shops in all of Sydney. After this we headed up to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/aqua-s-sydney">Aqua S</a>, where we all enjoyed their delicious Sea Salt &amp; Pandam iceream.</p>

<p>This icecream not only matters to me as an indicator to the end of our relationship Healthdirect, but also as the cornerstone of a friendship I share with <a href="https://instagram.com/mynameisdanger">Danger Del Rey</a>, the cutest drag queen you&rsquo;ve ever seen fall from Asia into our laps. Check her out sometime.</p>

<p>I reflect on the memories of the last 6 months and wouldn&rsquo;t trade a single moment for anything. Every step of the way with this organisation has been totally fruitful and very organic and I&rsquo;ve made some very good long-term friends from this.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you everyone for everything you&rsquo;ve offered me. Let us not say &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;, but instead <em>(as the French would have it)</em> <em>&ldquo;au revoir!&rdquo;</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is 3rd March and therefor marks the birthday of my oldest and dear friend Mike Amu (üê†) !</p>

<p>We caught up for breakfast this morning at a cafe in the Westfield building on Pitt St Mall on Level 5. There we had our usual share of coffee and cake before heading off to our daily rituals of meetings and work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so important to remember the important people in your life, the ones that have stayed there for a long time and don&rsquo;t move away from you heart - regardless of the distance. Michael and I have shared an enormous amount of love, joy, tears, lonliness, anger, fun, business, travel and so much more over the years. Next week is his birthday party which I will be flying back to Sydney for. The theme is masquerade which I&rsquo;ll be hanging out for, and we have a special guest performer !</p>

<p>I remember the first time I met Michael back when I was 20, and barely an adult myself. From that day forward, in the book that is my memories I began a new life on a road to self discovery and learning. Michael has been instrumental in my advancements as a person and as Danijel. I don&rsquo;t know how my life would have ended up if he hadn&rsquo;t crossed paths with me and I still share a special place in my heart for him.</p>

<p>So take the time to remember the people you love, you don&rsquo;t need to be in <em>love</em> with them, but remember them for who they are, what they do, and where your life has intersected with theirs. Ripples across a pond start with just one stone!</p>

    <updated>2016-03-02T22:35:32+10:30</updated>
    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/02/around-sydney-are-memories</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sometimes feel disconnected from the world around me and find solace with my Canon 600D walking around until it&rsquo;s really late at night just capturing moments of people around me. This can be here in Sydney or any other part of the world. Tonight I conned Jet and Tomas into being dragged around Sydney until the ungodly hours of the morning (I think we finished up around 1 ?) so I could retrace some places that Grenouille and I had been to on our adventures.</p>

<p>If I were to write a romance novel, it would be the moment I met him for dinner and drinks after work right up until the last we saw each other one last time at Hobart airport. But I don‚Äôt want to touch on that yet. Maybe one day I‚Äôll come back to visit that story.</p>

<p>We were retracing all the magical places I‚Äôve never seen before when Grenouille and I walked around. No destination in mind, just leaving the blind to lead the blind. I followed him and he followed me, just anywhere but home.</p>

<p>Looking back on it all, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single street I cannot now pass here in Sydney where I wasn‚Äôt following Grenouille, even to the deepest parts of the harbor - we saw it all!</p>

<p>Jet and Tomas haven‚Äôt been up near the new development that is known as Barangaroo. So we retraced the steps that were taken before across many journeys and it‚Äôs sad to say, that I‚Äôll probably not be here to see the final bricks to be laid for the most beautiful buildings.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/02/2016-02-27_DJW.0466.800res.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="‚Äòview of Barangaroo‚Äô ‚Äòview of Barangaroo‚Äô" ></p>

<p>I think the one on the left is the new casino. I‚Äôm not sure ? Maybe someone will drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/danijeljames">@danijeljames</a> and fill me in ?</p>

<p>The first time we came across Barangaroo was just after being up at the Observatory in the front gardens and we‚Äôd kissed under the white wood hut <em>(I don‚Äôt have a better description)</em> out the front. I remember leaning in to him and kissing him up his neck and him whispering to me ‚ÄòFuck you, Danijel James ≈†imunov!‚Äô. Glorious !</p>

<p>In short, ‚Äôtis a sight to see. I‚Äôd like to elaborate more on this article at a later stage and share some of the imagery from that night. I think there was a reflection of blue throughout most of the images and bring together all the important places.</p>

<p>One of the most magical places to visit at night, if you ever get the chance is the Observatory Hill Gazebo. It looks out across the northern side of the harbor, so over Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, Sydney Opera House and right out to the ocean. So beautiful the way the light dances off the water at night and captures the essence of love.</p>

<p>We stood there for a while as he taught me words like arbre, blanc, rouge, l‚Äôherb, verde. Recounting the objects around us, their names an the colors their transpire from. I still couldn‚Äôt say arbre. LOL ! Bats are called bald mice, but I can‚Äôt remember the words, as it was a mouthful. I just wanted to touch him and give him a kiss the first time we were there. It was before the first time we‚Äôd kissed when we went there. From the expressions of Jet and Tomas, I think they enjoyed the night overall, and the gazebo, both never having seen the view before.</p>

<h4>Install FUSE for OS X</h4>

<p>Install FUSE for OS X first, it&rsquo;s the base for connecting 3rd party file systems to the machine.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/02/2016-02-21_FUSE.for.OSX.png" width="312" height="219" title="ensure all options are checked" alt="FUSE for OS X"></p>

<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://osxfuse.github.io/">FUSE for OS X</a></p>

<h3>Install NTFS-3G</h3>

<p>Installing NTFS-3G enables the actual read/write to NTFS formatted drives. During install there is an option to use <code>No caching</code> or <code>UBLIO caching</code>. In my experience it&rsquo;s better to use <code>No caching</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/02/2016-02-21_to.cache.or.not.to.cache.png" width="312" height="220" title="to cache or not to cache" alt="UBLIO caching NTFS-3G"></p>

<p>Once this has been installed restart the machine.</p>

<p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://macntfs-3g.blogspot.com/2010/10/ntfs-3g-for-mac-os-x-2010102.html">NTFS-3G</a></p>

<h3>Install fuse-wait</h3>

<p>Post-reboot you will get the following error message:</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/02/2016-02-21_reboot.error.png" width="211" height="109" title="NTFS-3G post install error" alt="NTFS-3G post install error"></p>

<p>fuse-wait is a patch for NTFS-3G that just stops this annoying error messages from appearing on your system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sitting on my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, QF77, retrospectivey I have mixed emotions about the hospitality of people from Tasmania. In this hand it had to be one of the worst places for anyone to experience a welcome in all of Australia. And that includes Sydney. Disgusting. What happened to the good framework that this country was built upon? My travelling companion Grenouille (üê∏), may not have been able to understand the dymanics of three particular situations that played out at hand but I certainly did! On the other hand we were greeted like a lost stranger that had a reservation waiting to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>I arrived at <a href="http://www.hotbartinternational.com.au">Hobart Internaitional Airport</a> and was taken back at how small this place is. Really? This is an international travel destination? It&rsquo;s not even half the size of the old Adelaide International Airport before it was revamped a few years ago. Weird.</p>

<p>Getting off the plane my first messages from Grenouille warm and fuzzy until I was told the car licence was forgot and left behind. LOL! Double LOL! So Grenouille went back towards his place of stay and I resorted to my UK licence. Yes, scary as it may be for a lot of people, I do have a valid international licence and it won&rsquo;t be taken away from me. Yet. üòù</p>

<p>First up was Thank you for the welcome at <a href="http://www.redspot.com.au">RedSpot</a>, your assistance was amazing! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è You were friendly, welcoming, and extremely helpful. I would just like to mention you with a shout-out here on my blog. Thank you! üëçüèª</p>

<p>Bringing it right down to a shorter post, we travelled around Tasmania on Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi and Samedi.</p>

<h3>Day 1 Wednesday <em>(jour un mercredi)</em></h3>

<h4>Sorell Fruit Farm</h4>

<p>Amazing little farm a short stint out of Hobart. Bit annoyed that we couldn&rsquo;t go into the farm with just a single bucket between the two of us. We didn&rsquo;t really need two buckets <em>(large punnets)</em> between us to collect 3 apples, 2 pears and a handful of strawberries. Was fun! Grenouille couldn&rsquo;t pick a strawberry to save a life, but decided to steal mine to make the punnet look nice and plump. Pears were small but juicy. Nashi pears to be exact. Apples were yellow-ish in colour but nice. Strawberries were almost all gone but having worked on the Beerenberg Farm myself a few years back I knew how to pick them. The staff were a bit touchy with some of the Asian tourists who just wanted to walk around the orchards to look whilst one of them picked them. So they too were forced to buy a bucket each. Maybe they could fix this business model?</p>

<h4>Tasmanian Devil Park</h4>

<p>This was a little bit of a disappointment. It&rsquo;s the Tasmanian Devil Park Unzoo. It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;zoo&rdquo; per se, but they help in the breeding and conservation of the Tasmanian Devil. Unbeknown to most, the Tasmanian Devil suffers from a cancer that is transmitted by blood - much like the HIV virus. And also like the HIV virus, we don&rsquo;t know where it came from <em>(the cancer)</em>. My favourite part was going out to the Kangaroos to play, watching Quolls devour an animal carcass and the feeding of the Tasmanian Devil. So voracious! Both of them! Who ever thought a Quoll was such a savage eater! üò∞</p>

<h4>Eaglehawk Neck Historic Site</h4>

<p>Eaglehawk Neck had some natural formations that really take a moment to let sink into the mind. The Tessellated Pavement Slate Reserve down on the beach shore looked like tiles laid by man from above, upon closer inspection we reaslised it was natural formations from erosion of the stone over years from the ocean.</p>

<h4>Coal Mines</h4>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t take my camera with me, so I have no real images of this place. It&rsquo;s a long walk of scattered ruins and a quarry that goes deep in to the ground. An eerie Silent Hill effect wavers over this point of interest. If you&rsquo;re easily scared, don&rsquo;t go here. We did see this little cute echidna and Grenouille managed to snap an amazing shot of a short-billed echidna!</p>

<h4>Port Arthur</h4>

<p>Resting on Port Arthur for the night, everything closes at 8pm. Literally, everything. Grenouille and I got a ch√¢let at <a href="http://www.portarthurvillas.com.au">Port Arthur Villas</a> and they took us in late at night without much ado. A bit pricey for my liking, but what the hell, we&rsquo;re on holidays afterall! Wonderful room with amazing views. Awesome breakfast in the morning too!</p>

<p>Before we turned it in we headed down the road to a recommendation from our innkeeper to the <a href="http://www.portarthur.org.au">Port Arthur Historic Site</a> bistro restuarant. Greeted by the lovliest old queen <em>(yasss, kween üôåüèª)</em> who tended to our whims and needs. Heck, he even gave up 4 of his own cigarettes because no shops where open when we were leaving! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Dinner was an amazing salmon dish served on a bed of noodles. Wonderful!</p>

<h3>Day 2 Thursday <em>(jour deux jeudi)</em></h3>

<h4>Callington Mill - Oatlands</h4>

<p>After a brief stop for petrol at the town before, I ducked in quickly to the local candy store leaving Grenouille wondering where I was! üòÅ</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/tasmania-trip/20160218.iPhone6Plus.142116.jpg" width="600" height="800" title="Danijel in the candy store" alt="Cochon in a candy store"></p>

<p>On we headed to see the local windmill which was easy to see from afar, just proving tricky to find up close. The Callington Mill is a working Gregorian windmill built in 1837. That&rsquo;s all I can say about it. It&rsquo;s not really that exciting, and there&rsquo;s nothing to tell about it. üòï To make the story more exciting, there were <code>#wasps</code> nearby.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/tasmania-trip/DJW.20160218.600D.0145.800res.jpg" width="533" height="800" title="Callington Mill" alt="Callington Windmill"></p>

<p>Being a little hungry we headed into town to try the Pancake and Crepe Shop. Without going into it too much here on this page, please feel free to head over to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au">Yelp!</a> to check out my review <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/pancake-and-crepe-shop-oatlands">here</a>. In short, it was crap. Everything about this place was crap. I&rsquo;d love to know that in time, people are able to go here and give a higher rating than I was.</p>

<h4>Spring Vale Vineyards - Cranbrook</h4>

<p>Whenever I think of Vineyards, I think of rich snobby cunts or those that like to think they&rsquo;re rich snobby cunts - the complete opposite here! Greeted warmly and with welcome that reminds me of my father inviting people to the dinner table to share a meal. We tried every type of white and red on the menu walking away with a 750mL of white and smaller bottle of red. I&rsquo;ll keep these as a memory to share with Grenouille in a month from now when I see him on Adelaide. We had a quick tour of the vineyards and just enjoyed a casual stroll amongst the vines. Lovely.</p>

<h4>Coles Bay</h4>

<p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t find my pictures from this location and will have to go back through my Lightroom catalog to see where they went. I hope I haven&rsquo;t lost them! üò∞ I took some amazing photos here and almost fell off a cliff getting them! üò° Coles Bay gives you surmountable views of the ocean.</p>

<h4>Wineglass Bay</h4>

<p>Wineglass Bay is a bit of a hike up the mountain. You need to purchase access for your car at the local centre on the way down or risk getting a fine. At least the car ticket allows up to 8 people to access the park and climb up. I met a young couple who were taking <em>(or trying to)</em> romantic photos of one another. Being a complete sucker to help people capture memories the way their imagination sees it, I took her camera and snapped a few wonderful shots of them wit hthe view of the water behind them. She was a bit stuck up. But meh. üòè</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/tasmania-trip/DJW.20160218.600D.0160.800res.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="Wineglass Bay" alt="Wineglass Bay, TAS"></p>

<p>I quickly also snuck in an image of these Asian tourists sitting down to rest. When Grenouille and I were reviewing photos he asked me _&ldquo;Do you know these people? Are they your friends?&rdquo; LOL, no dear. I love you because you&rsquo;re so silly sometimes. üòò I&rsquo;m a photographer in the making, I capture memories.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/tasmania-trip/DJW.20160218.600D.0166.800res.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="Random Asian Tourists" alt="Random Asian Tourists"></p>

<h4>Bicheno &amp; Penguin Tour</h4>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t penguins just the darnest little things? Theys&rsquo;re so adorable and the firs thing that comes to mind when I say penguin in most kids my age is Pengu! We arrived in the town of Bicheno but unfortunately as I hadn&rsquo;t booked far enough in advance like Grenouille asked me to we didn&rsquo;t rest here for the night. We had to continue on to St Helens - much further down the way!</p>

<p>The town of Bicheno is quite small, almost just a tourist destination. We had dinner at <a href="http://thesealifecentre.com.au">Sea Life Centre</a> and unfortunately it&rsquo;s the second place that I was absolutely disgusted at the level of service and hospitality received. Not for myself and Grenouille, but for this poor Asian tourist family of 3 <em>(trois personnes)</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t anything short of dispicable. I&rsquo;m yet to write up a review on Yelp! about this place, but believe me it won&rsquo;t be anything short of the truth. The food here was also a bit of a let down. Fish of the Day was Broadfish and really was a reflection of their patronage.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/tasmania-trip/20160218.iPhone6Plus.200417.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="Fish of the Day - Broadfish" alt="Fish of the Day - Broadfish"></p>

<p>After dinner we moved over to the <a href="http://www.bichenopenguintours.com.au">Bicheno Penguin Tour</a> carpark and bought our tickets ready to board bus no. 4 <em>(autobus numero quatre)</em> to head off and see these darling little birds. Unknown to me, these are the same penguins on Granite Island off the coast of Victor Harbour, SA.</p>

<p>The tour was licensed by some commission and they help in the repopulation of penguins in Australia. As penguins are light sensitive animals, photography of any kind wasn&rsquo;t allowed so I couldn&rsquo;t snap any photos for the two of us. We were supposed to write to them asking for photos but I&rsquo;ve forgotten to do this at the time of writing so when this post gets re-edited, I&rsquo;ll have to add a pic of what we saw to this article. Grenouille has the pics already. I&rsquo;m just a banana! <em>(Je suis un banane!)</em> üçå</p>

<h4>Tidal Waters Resort St Helens</h4>

<p>Wow&hellip;remember people to book your accomodation WELL in advance of travel, else end up like us travelling for an hour to the town a few clicks down the road for a night stay! I don&rsquo;t have much to say about this place except the accomodation was great, the in-house services was amazing and if you ever want to get married give this place a look. They have all the services you&rsquo;d expect from a 4&#189; star accomodation rating. Beautiful! And the best part wasn&rsquo;t even having to move the car to the carpark. The night manager let us keep it slap-bang in the middle of the driveway! We were up early enough to have breakfast but didn&rsquo;t make it in time. üòÅ A fantastic recommendation from the said manager in the morning started our journey the very next day, jour trois vendredi!</p>

<h3>Day 3 Friday <em>(jour trois vendredi)</em></h3>

<h4>Mohr and Smith</h4>

<p>Following the recommendation from our place of stay, we left our car in place and walked the 8 mins to the shop. Yes, this was much against my desire to walk but what choice did I have? I am the lazy Cochon (üê∑) and he is the Grenouille! So around the corner we did walk with a quick stop to grab some cash <em>(rub your chin when you say that aloud, it has a good effect!)</em> and to be honest - it looked like a Mercerella Bros venue than somewhere you&rsquo;d expect to have brunch. First impressions from the outside blew me away the moment we stepped through the door and greeted by the wonderful man serving coffee at the bar who politely told us to discover a place we feel comfortable and he&rsquo;ll be right over.</p>

<p>We grabbed a menu at the door as we walked in so that means I could start to devour the food mentally without having to wait hand and foot on the service of the staff. In this case the only staff member in sight!</p>

<p>I went with the French Toast üá´üá∑ served with caramelised apples and marscapone. This was nothing short of amazing! üòç The bread was lightly toasted, brioche in style, with a sufficient drizzle of flavour begging you to take more. It was like the devil had created a dish to keep the gluttons being glutonous!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/tasmania-trip/2016.0219.iPhone6Plus.103404.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="French Toast" alt="French toast, caramelised apples & marscapone cheese"></p>

<p>Wonderful fast service, friendly atmosphere, a real Sydney <em>chic</em> vibe to be found here right in the heart of Tasmanian country. This place deserves its 5-star rating on Yelp! If I could move this to anywhere, it would be Pyrmont in Sydney. Perfect all round! Try it if you ever get to pass through on the way to anywhere!</p>

<h4>Bay of Fires</h4>

<p>Bay of Fires <em>(named so in 1773)</em> is an amazing secluded beach stretching from Binnalong Bay right up around the coast. It took us a few tries to get close enough to the rocks we could see in the distance and listening to some of my favourite tracks on the iPhone and then braving the wilderness barefoot to get there, but we did in the end. Poor Grenouille really is delicate and couldn&rsquo;t stand on the hot Australian sand or rough ground without hurting his poor soles! I should have been nice enough to pick him up, but in my usual I was too busy laughing or well, just laughing.</p>

<p>Apart from the wasps, and nearly being dragged out to the ocean trying to catch an amazing shot of the water splashing against the foot of the orange hued rocks, there is nothing here short of paradise.</p>

<p>Rather than talk about it, look over these images. I&rsquo;ve also uploaded an album to my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/danijeljames">Flickr</a> account that you can look at with the hi-res images of all these pics and more.</p>

<p>After the Bay of Fires, we headed back to St Helens to grab some grapes, local cheeses, crackers and soda water before our trip back to Hobart. Unfortunately, as luck would have it, we didn&rsquo;t rest where we expected for the night and ended up in a town about 30min west of Hobart called Tynwald at an amazing home-run cottage called Tynwald Willow Bend Estate.</p>

<h4>Tynwald Willow Bend Estate</h4>

<p>Unfortunately I have no photos of the estate itself, but they can be found on <a href="https://images.google.com">Google Images</a>. Greeted by <em>(what I believe is the husband)</em> of the lady that I spoke to on the phone, I was ushered through the manor to the dining room, the reading room, the the breakfast room and then to a book on the <a href="http://www.hobartcity.com.au/hobart/hobart_events/salamanca_market">Salamanca Markets</a>. She has a frined that runs the bee was stall closest to the entrance. Grenouille and I dropped off our things, had a spa, shower, got dressed then headed to town for dinner. If you&rsquo;re ever in the area, give it a go. It&rsquo;s wonderful. Very old fashioned and run the way a manor should and you&rsquo;d not want or need for anything as the family-run estate has it all. It is a little behind the times but you&rsquo;ll love the feel if you miss your grandma&rsquo;s house from when you were a child. Re-living it as an adult gives you a sense of when things were simpler and people were innocent.</p>

<h4>Rockwall Bar and Grill</h4>

<p>How this place is a bar is beyond me. You walk to the end of Salamanca Pl and see a small sign hinged above a door giving indication of where it is. Walk through a sliding electronic glass door and almost immediately you&rsquo;re greeted by friendly and warm staff from all angles asking you for a drink whilst you wait and what was the reservation. This a no-bullshit kind of venue! Immediately after getting your wine <em>(we took the bottle of some local Tasmanian label)</em> you notice the ambient atmosphere is signature to the venue - this place has some intense class!</p>

<p>Before getting through 2 sips we&rsquo;re ushered to our table and sat down between a couple of where about to have their first child and a couple who&rsquo;ve been together for so many years the lines on their faces showed all the good times, the bad times and all the times in between. Discussions on one side of the table ranged from talk of holidays taken to holidays to be taken. Such extremes to create a balance.</p>

<p>Grenouille and I ordered the Pumpkin Risotto and onion rings. It hadn&rsquo;t even occured to me that maybe this kind of dish would normally be sold in America, UK and Australia predominately with maybe a few locations scattered around the globe in tow! None the wiser what it was until I explained.</p>

<p>After dinner we headed off back to Tynwald to rest the night before heading off back to see MONA and the Salmanaca Markets in the morning.</p>

<h3>Day 4 Saturday <em>(jour quatre samedi)</em></h3>

<h4>Salamanca Markets</h4>

<p>Quoted as <em>&ldquo;The best markets in Australia&rdquo;</em> is not a title short of being deserved! A complete immersion in the siggts, sounds, flavours, action and colour that makes Tasmania unique can be found here. Every Saturday from 8:30 until 15:00 is where the action is. The highlight of my visit? This coffee cup, of course!</p>

<h4>MONA - Museum of Old and New Art</h4>

<p>Before I headed down this week to join Grenouille I spoke about my intended journey with the Chief of Operations Executive Assistant and she told me to take some time to see the Museum of Old and New Art <em>(MONA)</em>. Luckily, I took that advise. Sure, some of the art is weird or something I can&rsquo;t consider to be art, but I implore this above all - visit MONA if you visit Tasmania for the sake of exploring art not artists.</p>

<p>I could write more about this but it&rsquo;s better to leave you with this single image from the artwork that helped me decide to ask Grenouille to add this to our itinerary.</p>

<h4>Hobart International Airport</h4>

<p><em>&ldquo;All good things must come to an end&rdquo; -Geoffrey Chaucer</em> are the only words that come to mind when we arrived here. This destination in our journey across Tasmania means that Grenouille and Cochon were about to go separate ways on separate journeys.</p>

<p>We had our last meal together and off he flew to his next leg as did I back to Sydney. So here I am, on flight Jetstar flight QF77 going back over the memories that should not be forgotten lest left off the pages that make up the story of this world.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Hobart,</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know I was thirsty until I tasted your wine with love from France. Now I know I&rsquo;m dying without another sip.</p>

<p>Regards,
Danijel James</p>

<hr />

<p>In short - don&rsquo;t eat at the following places until they improve their customer service to a standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pancake &amp; Crepe Shop, Oatlands, TAS</li>
<li>Sea Life Centre, Bicheno, TAS</li>
</ul>


<p>Everywhere else is OK üòâ</p>
