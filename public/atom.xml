    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>A Little Bit of History</h4>

<p>The many settles of Eba built their own school in 1894, south of Eba. The walls of limestone are still upright and the limestone with 1894 etched in it was placed above the main door. It is weathering away and the etched numerals are hard to spot. The Lutheran settlers worshipped here (Section 246 in the Hundred of Eba). Later, a school was built next to the Albert Keough home, Section 188 in the Hundred of Eba, but this was not a satisfactory arrangement, so school was held in one of the empty settler&rsquo;s cottages.</p>

<p>Ebay Railway Siding has only the platform left as a reminder of busier days gone by. The 1984 school was build on Heppner land and is marked on old Morgan Council maps. Eba also boasted a Race Track; this was also on Heppner property. The track was laid around a small hill with the spectators on the mallee shaded hill, Section 201 in the Hundred of Eba. This gave the an unrestricted view of the races. The last Race Train from Kapunda to Eba ran in May of the year 1911.</p>

He&rsquo;s just been given a new choke-chain this arvo by my mum &lsquo;cos he is a pretty big dog and can&rsquo;t be handled easily without some restraint. I&rsquo;ve decided to bring him down to the local dog park or &ldquo;Pooch Park&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s colloquially known.</p>

<p>We get down there after I drove him in the car Ante <em>(the youngest of us 3 boys)</em> gave me, and Cæsar&rsquo;s 🐶 somehow slobbered all over my windows at this point, so out the car and off we go. A short run around the park and sniff and scratch we go for a walk down under the bridge and along the river front</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/07/bonjour-adelaide</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A late start today. I had intended to get up early, go out, have coffee and pastry, peruse around the city soaking in the places I&rsquo;ve not seen since yesteryear and try to find the new changes. I was only here recently in Adelaide for the Healthdirect Christmas break plus a few days, but I was more of a tourist then. I had no intentions to settle down here for a bit and stand still a little while. Now I&rsquo;m back&nbsp;!</p>

<p>Badger <em>(his nickname, I didn&rsquo;t give it to &lsquo;im)</em> has given me a recommendation for coffee this morning. I finally got to the city just after 13:00 and had a walk down memory lane - <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Leigh+St,+Adelaide+SA+5000/@-34.8450789,138.5735432,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ab0cf28363480a7:0xa7fac227eb958f23">Leigh St</a> - where years ago my ex partner Mike and I had a cafe. Actually, we had a cafe on Leigh St, Topham Mall and &hellip; I forgot the connecting street on the other side of Leigh St. I wanna say Bent St, but that doesn&rsquo;t sound right. I guess I could <a href="https://maps.google.com.au">Google</a> it, meh.</p>

<p>So anyway, got into the city, walked down Leigh St, fabulous culture nestled up here hidden away from the dredges of Hindley St. No hookers. Drugs. Habbibi&rsquo;s. Nada! I spotted a little French restaurant that I&rsquo;d like to go back and try this week, people sitting outside laughing and enjoying their Indian meals <em>(were they Halal&nbsp;?)</em> and the vibe was just there. It&rsquo;s almost brewing into a hipster lifestyle.</p>

<p>Stumbling up the little lane with my eyes peeled for everything around me, I found <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/coffee-branch-adelaide">coffee branch</a>, a virtual hole-in-the-wall type shop. You shuffle in, you order, you shuffle out with coffee in hand and some pastry too! I myself got a <a href="http://www.milo.com.au">Milo-flavoured</a> cronut. First thing I noticed was the style. Very hipster! If I closed my eyes and opened them between Newtown and Adelaide I&rsquo;d hardly notice any difference. The price of soy, coconut and almond milk was a little steep <em>(80¢ Adelaide vs 50¢ Sydney)</em> but well worth it for the overall cost. Friendly staff, amazing decor, profiled origin, chalkboards, a grade of rustic - it was pretty much love at first sight!</p>

<p>I ordered my usual large soy latte, no sugar thnx ☕️ ✌🏻</p>

<p>After a few minutes they called out my name and I shuffled out of the store and out the front to the tables to grab a quick snap of my cup. It&rsquo;s totally adorable!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.125225.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="coffee from coffee branch on leigh st" alt="coffee branch : 32 leigh st : Adelaide"></p>

<p>Any shop that wants to precede it&rsquo;s reputation will use custom printed cups. Not only does it embed their brand in my mind, it&rsquo;s associative with the quality - let&rsquo;s tuck in!</p>

<p>First sip, clearly burnt my tongue. Why do I do this every time to myself&nbsp;? Seriously I&rsquo;m stupid at the best of times&nbsp;! 😂 Maybe this is why I&rsquo;m single still&nbsp;? 😏 Second sip, yeurk! What is this&nbsp;? It&rsquo;s strong&nbsp;! It&rsquo;s real coffee&nbsp;! I honestly hadn&rsquo;t expected this. I need another sip. <em><em>sips coffee</em></em> Wow&nbsp;! This is amazing&nbsp;!</p>

<p>I can safely say this is a 4&#189; star rating coffee from me to you. I&rsquo;m going to review them later on Yelp! and go back for some more photos of the joint. I&rsquo;m adding this to a list later and will be back to visit sometime again soon. Give it a shot&nbsp;! <em>(excuse the pun)</em></p>

<p>Moving along to <a href="http://rundlemall.com">Rundle Mall</a>, I swooped in to grab the obligatory selfie in the Malls Balls and then grabbed another few pics that just show this timeless piece of artwork. The Rundle Mall Balls are a central icon to the city and I don&rsquo;t know where we&rsquo;d be with out them&nbsp;!</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160306.iPhone6Plus.1473.800res.jpg" width="800" height="500" title="Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls" alt="Rundle Mall Balls - malls balls"></p>

<p>One of the greatest things to do in a new city is just walk around and admire the public art. Spouted as the artsy capital of Australia, Melbourne has a plethora of magical art in all forms for the public to admire. It gives a sense of culture to the city. Adelaide, the Festival State, traditionally known for churches and theatre is slowly creeping up with awesome installations popping up all over the place. It&rsquo;s not like thy&rsquo;ve tried to copy any other setups across the globe, but reinvent the wheel with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_art_in_South_Australia">own attractions</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160307.iPhone6Plus.1744.600res.jpg" width="600" height="600" title="artwork in Rundle Mall" alt="Rundle Mall D20 bronze artwork"></p>

<p>Not sure what what you&rsquo;d call this, but I dub it the <strong>Rundle Mall D20</strong>. I&rsquo;m not counting the sides, but it was pretty to look at, nice and shiny, and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having one in my front yard to look at each morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Get out your glitter, <a href="https://smirnoff.com">vodka</a>, <a href="https://aussiebum.com.au">speedos</a>, tune into <a href="https://sbs.com.au">SBS</a> and log off <a href="https://grindr.com">Grindr</a>, it&rsquo;s that time of year as the Sydney Mardi Gras has arrived! Sporting some of the most fabulous attitudes, fashions and wigs you&rsquo;ve seen this side of the globe it&rsquo;s Christmas for the Gays!</p>

<p>Having been an avid fan of the Mardi Gras for as long as I can remember I was able to work in the Control Room last year being the sole point of contact for the parade floats as they eagerly awaited instructions to step out onto route from Hyde Park. <em>What could go wrong?&ldquo;</em> I asked myself as I volunteered to take the position that everyone else seemed reluctant to raise their hands&hellip;what did go wrong indeed! We survived, and we&rsquo;ll continue to survive for as long as an iota of flair exists - we&rsquo;ll take it and run a marathon.</p>

<p>This year I decided to part ways with Sydney before the Mardi Gras parade and step away from everything in silence. I&rsquo;m currently aboard <a href="https://virginaustralia.com.au">Virgin</a> flight VA412 where I hope <em>(yes, hope!)</em> to be greeted by my parents upon landing and brought to my new house.</p>

<p>There will be no celebrations tonight, maybe just coffee with an old friend that time has kept tucked away and my camera in hand. Who ever said it&rsquo;s kosher for a photographer to not have his camera on hand anyway? It&rsquo;s always socially acceptable. 😀</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already had my celebrations last night on Oxford St one last time and take this little token with me where I go.</p>

<p>To everyone out and about in Sydney tonight, please stay safe, stay happy, stay fabulous and enjoy this special occasion. Don&rsquo;t forget to tag your posts with <code>#MardiGras</code> so that we can find them later and share in the joy.</p>

<p>And to the man in front of me, if you move your fucking chair one more time I&rsquo;ll karate punch you to the fanny! 😡</p>

<p>On a lighter note, you&rsquo;ll know when you arrive in Adelaide and can see the familiar red signage of <a href="https://cibo.com.au">「cibo」</a> in front of you!</p>

Amazing coffee, and simple menu. You should try it when <em>(not if)</em> you take a stroll down any of Adelaide&rsquo;s iconic suburbs.</p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/04/goodbye-healthdirect</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember the first time I was contacted about a position at <a href="https://healthdirect.org.au">Healthdirect Australia</a>. I never applied for the job, I was asked to go to an interview that had been tee&rsquo;d up! Was I being head-hunted for this role or did someone pass my name along as a favour? I never found out and sometimes it&rsquo;s better to not know the whole story anyway!</p>

<p>6 months have passed <em>(a week)</em> since that first time and here we are parting ways. It must be said that Healthdirect and all her employees have been truly monumental in my career development and integral to my development as a person. I cannot express in words how overwhelmed I have been with the reception from the company as I parted ways today. Thank you, everyone!</p>

<p>For the usual send-off, the Corporate IT team will head down and enjoy lunch <i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i> together in honour of the person who&rsquo;s departing or their birthday. We enjoyed a meal at <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/misschu-sydney">MissChu</a>, one of my favourite Vietnamese shops in all of Sydney. After this we headed up to <a href="https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/aqua-s-sydney">Aqua S</a>, where we all enjoyed their delicious Sea Salt &amp; Pandam iceream.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/03/20160304.iPhone6Plus.132515.800res.jpg" width="800" height="800" title="aqua S sea salt & pandam" alt="aqua S - sea salt & pandam icecream"></p>

<p>This icecream not only matters to me as an indicator to the end of our relationship Healthdirect, but also as the cornerstone of a friendship I share with <a href="https://instagram.com/mynameisdanger">Danger Del Rey</a>, the cutest drag queen you&rsquo;ve ever seen fall from Asia into our laps. Check her out sometime.</p>

<p>I reflect on the memories of the last 6 months and wouldn&rsquo;t trade a single moment for anything. Every step of the way with this organisation has been totally fruitful and very organic and I&rsquo;ve made some very good long-term friends from this.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you everyone for everything you&rsquo;ve offered me. Let us not say &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;, but instead <em>(as the French would have it)</em> <em>&ldquo;au revoir!&rdquo;</em></p>

    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/03/happy-birthday-michael</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is 3rd March and therefor marks the birthday of my oldest and dear friend Mike Amu (🐠) !</p>

<p>We caught up for breakfast this morning at a cafe in the Westfield building on Pitt St Mall on Level 5. There we had our usual share of coffee and cake before heading off to our daily rituals of meetings and work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so important to remember the important people in your life, the ones that have stayed there for a long time and don&rsquo;t move away from you heart - regardless of the distance. Michael and I have shared an enormous amount of love, joy, tears, lonliness, anger, fun, business, travel and so much more over the years. Next week is his birthday party which I will be flying back to Sydney for. The theme is masquerade which I&rsquo;ll be hanging out for, and we have a special guest performer !</p>

<p>I remember the first time I met Michael back when I was 20, and barely an adult myself. From that day forward, in the book that is my memories I began a new life on a road to self discovery and learning. Michael has been instrumental in my advancements as a person and as Danijel. I don&rsquo;t know how my life would have ended up if he hadn&rsquo;t crossed paths with me and I still share a special place in my heart for him.</p>

<p>So take the time to remember the people you love, you don&rsquo;t need to be in <em>love</em> with them, but remember them for who they are, what they do, and where your life has intersected with theirs. Ripples across a pond start with just one stone!</p>

    <updated>2016-03-02T22:35:32+10:30</updated>
    <id>http://danijelj.com/blog/2016/03/02/around-sydney-are-memories</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sometimes feel disconnected from the world around me and find solace with my Canon 600D walking around until it&rsquo;s really late at night just capturing moments of people around me. This can be here in Sydney or any other part of the world. Tonight I conned Jet and Tomas into being dragged around Sydney until the ungodly hours of the morning (I think we finished up around 1 ?) so I could retrace some places that Grenouille and I had been to on our adventures.</p>

<p>If I were to write a romance novel, it would be the moment I met him for dinner and drinks after work right up until the last we saw each other one last time at Hobart airport. But I don’t want to touch on that yet. Maybe one day I’ll come back to visit that story.</p>

<p>We were retracing all the magical places I’ve never seen before when Grenouille and I walked around. No destination in mind, just leaving the blind to lead the blind. I followed him and he followed me, just anywhere but home.</p>

<p>Looking back on it all, I don’t think there’s a single street I cannot now pass here in Sydney where I wasn’t following Grenouille, even to the deepest parts of the harbor - we saw it all!</p>

<p>Jet and Tomas haven’t been up near the new development that is known as Barangaroo. So we retraced the steps that were taken before across many journeys and it’s sad to say, that I’ll probably not be here to see the final bricks to be laid for the most beautiful buildings.</p>

<p><img src="http://danijelj.com/images/2016/02/2016-02-27_DJW.0466.800res.jpg" width="800" height="533" title="‘view of Barangaroo’ ‘view of Barangaroo’" ></p>

<p>I think the one on the left is the new casino. I’m not sure ? Maybe someone will drop me a line on <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/danijeljames">@danijeljames</a> and fill me in ?</p>

<p>The first time we came across Barangaroo was just after being up at the Observatory in the front gardens and we’d kissed under the white wood hut <em>(I don’t have a better description)</em> out the front. I remember leaning in to him and kissing him up his neck and him whispering to me ‘Fuck you, Danijel James Šimunov!’. Glorious !</p>

<p>In short, ’tis a sight to see. I’d like to elaborate more on this article at a later stage and share some of the imagery from that night. I think there was a reflection of blue throughout most of the images and bring together all the important places.</p>

<p>One of the most magical places to visit at night, if you ever get the chance is the Observatory Hill Gazebo. It looks out across the northern side of the harbor, so over Circular Quay, the Harbor Bridge, Sydney Opera House and right out to the ocean. So beautiful the way the light dances off the water at night and captures the essence of love.</p>

<p>We stood there for a while as he taught me words like arbre, blanc, rouge, l’herb, verde. Recounting the objects around us, their names an the colors their transpire from. I still couldn’t say arbre. LOL ! Bats are called bald mice, but I can’t remember the words, as it was a mouthful. I just wanted to touch him and give him a kiss the first time we were there. It was before the first time we’d kissed when we went there. From the expressions of Jet and Tomas, I think they enjoyed the night overall, and the gazebo, both never having seen the view before.</p>
