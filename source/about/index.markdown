###Hello and welcome to danijelj.com

Here at danijelj.com you'll find a collection of my thoughts, learning and opinions on photography, french &amp; hacking based on my professional and personal opinons.

Originally started as a technical solutions blog for all things related to BSD, OS X &amp; Linux, I've revamped this entire blog to be my personal space that I can start to capture all three of the major interests in my life that hold a long-term part of my soul.

Through photography I will capture the everyday essence and stories that should be put to a book. Too often I've had to say to people the same lines over and over. I kinda get sick of it now.

> If I told you all the shit I've really done in my life, you'd think I was making up half of it. That's the sad part!

I think I've come to a point where I've realised I do live my life in a way that can only be captured in pictures - so I'm gonna do just that !

We've all read the French are the aristocrates of all things love. Initially I brought French to this blog as part of my study and intentions to move to Paris to live out my remaining days. What was I thinking ? No. No. And no. It's not gonna happen. When I go to France, it will be with the man I've met who stole a piece of my heart. The category of ["French"](https://www.danijelj.com/blog/categories/french/) will now solely dedicated to love.

>La vie est une fleur dont lâ€™amour est le miel.

Hacking is where I'll reserve my technical endeavours, solutions and problems _(most of which I probably create for myself)_.

Feel free to follow me on [Twitter <i class="fa  fa-twitter"></i>](http://www.twitter.com/danijeljw) or [Instagram fa-instagram](https://www.instagram.com/danijeljw/) where I sometimes post random stuff. Unfortunately I'm not accepting any new friends on [Facebook <i class="fa fa-facebook"></i>](http://facebook.com/danijel.james) because I would like to keep that just to the people I know but you can follow me or send me a message if you need help with something. ðŸ˜‰
