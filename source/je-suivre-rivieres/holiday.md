The holiday for a fortnight must start at the end of a work week (Friday) and end on the Sunday preceding the day before work. The adjustment period should be minimal and resume normal life as it transitions naturally.


# Jour Un
Leaving Friday after work, head to the airport and take off for Alice Springs. Go grab your hire care that you prepped ahead of time and get to your motel. Don't worry about staying somewhere comfortable. It's not important. It's just where you're gonna be for the night.

Get up early in the morning. Really early. It's holiday time but it's no time to be lazy, it's Saturday morning and it's your first day. Get in your car and drive to GPS co-ordinates *25°19'47.3"S 130°57'17.4"E*. Make sure you bring your coffee and vegemite toast. You'll be need to be here at no later than 6:30am. Pull over and have your camera ready, you're about to see some magic happen from the East. I hope it's a clouded, but not overcast, morning.

Once you've soaked up all the beauty you can handle, get back in the car and drive back around the front entrance of the monolith and climb it. _(I hope your ate breakfast like I told you to !)_ You'd expect to be up the top and singing the book by about 11am latest. If not, you're lazy.

Get on down, back in your car and head to Hanuman Alice Springs. Don't complain. _(Don't complain, I'm choosing where you're going.)_

Earth Sanctuary World Nature Centre is where you'll be heading this evening. So maybe have some down time and walk around, enjoy a glass. Go to the Anzac Hill lookout. Just don't overwork yourself.

I hope you read this ahead of time, now you should have made a booking with the aforementioned venue. _(Their phone number is *08 8953 6161*, in case your need it!)_ Meet up with the rest of the folk and go out exploring the stars. See the jewels spread across the sky. Spend your time in awe and capturing the beauty of the heavens shining down on you. Do you remember ? Remember when you were made of the same stuff as I ? Were were once stardust my dear. We come from dust and return to dust - in the heart of stars eternally.

After the show head back to your motel for the night. You're gonna be packing up and starting Jour Duex soon.

# Jour Deux
Take the car back to the airport and get ready. You're about to head off again. Are you wearing fresh underwear ? I hope so ! 😜

Today you're departing or Brisbane. One you get there catch the train to the city. You'll need to grab a Brisbane GO card. Much like the SA transport care _(that I keep calling an Opal card)_ except it's better. Have you had anything to eat yet ? Of course not. Don't be stupid. I know you. Once you get to town the first stop is going to be finding a little laneway called *Little Burnett Lane*. There's a cafe here. _(Do you trust me ? I hope so. I trust these words. Hell, I'm the architect here !)_

_(So, I was listening to Meat Loaf's - You Took The Words Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night) as I wrote this next part, so I felt it perfect that I adapt it for you here:)_

I'm imagining you've found the place yet ? No ? Well hurry along. You're supposed to be standing at BREW now. Grab your menu and start licking your lips.

_(queue backing track)_

You were licking your lips,
and your chapstick shining.
You were dying just to ask for coffee.
You're just standing there in a laneway shop
by the story I told you.
You now there's not another moment,
not another moment,
not another moment to waste

You hold the menu close that your eyes grow wide.
But your tongue is licking all over your lips.
You're trying to speak
But not matter what you do
You just can't seem to decide.

And so, let me take the words right out of your mouth and write them here. 😉

Order:

- Avocado on Toast add Egg - _w/ goats cheese ricotta mousse, fresh lemon_
- Large soy latte, no sugar
- Small bottle of sparkling water

Take your seat in the laneway and have them bring it out to you. You're on holiday. I hope you're camera is ready, take a happy snap and upload it to Instagram _(insert Anjelah Johnson saying "Sir don't lie, I can see..." quote here about not having instagram; yeah, I saw you liked a photo_ 😘_)_

Finish up your brunch. Feel full ? Good. We should be near midday now. I want you to get your way around to Roma Street Parkland. It's a beautiful park in the heart of Spring Hill _(or is it on the edge ?)_. We're going to take a walk around the 16 hectares of beautiful park and soak it all in.

Don't worry about not knowing where you're going. I'll add maps to this when it's finished.

I want you to particularly walk slowly through the Spectacle Garden. This is mostly important as the work put into this ensures that any visitor has something to see and smell at all times of the year. I'm bringing you here because it doesn't matter when you come, you'll be sure to see colours born of hearth.

Sift around the rest of the gardens and don't hesitate to take a pen and paper from your bag and write a wish on there. Just one wish. Try for something simple and sweet. Anything you want. Find the most beautiful flower you can by sight and smell. Do you remember that wish ? I want you to bury the paper right under the plant the flower so does bloom from. Thank the flower and be on your way. It's time for getting to the motel and you'll probably need a shower and to relax a bit.

Yes, I did say "chapstick" up earlier. I hope you're drinking plenty of water, wear sunscreen and have chapstick on. Preferably Burt's Bees Wax. The one with mint. It's sassy (like you) !

Dinner is your next stop, and I'm assuming it's late in the afternoon now.

You'll be heading to a place called Blackbird Bar & Grill. They are a relative newcomer to the Eagle Street Pier dining precinct, _(so many metaphors to reference here, I shall stick to my story and stop diverting)_. Make sure you've booked ahead of time.

Their phone number is (07) 3229 1200 and you'll get to them at 123 Eagle St, Brisbane. They're in the Riverside Centre.

Honestly you don't even need to know what you're picking from the menu. Everything, and I mean this, is amazing. Ask your waitress to pick something for you based on what you don't eat, that way you can leave her open to opportunities. Let it be a surprise. You're on holidays anyway. Maybe pick a glass of New Zealand white from their menu. I want you to stay sober, so don't drink more than a glass. Wash it down with a glass of water and then head to the bar. You're in Brisbane bitch, it's time to crack out the cocktails. Yep ! I've brought you to a fucking amazing cocktail bar. Pick any two items from the menu _(except for an espresso martini, this isn't Sydney)_ and savour ever drop of flavour from the glass.

_(Side note, did you know that glass is the only chalice that lets you taste as close to origin unless you use crystal! So for this reason, it was more commonly acceptable to say "transparent like glass" because crystal was out of reach from common folk!)_

Don't stay for more than 2 drinks. That's all you need. We're going to head off for a walk along the banks of the river up north as you watch the lights dance over the beating stream. Soon you'll have Macrossan St on your left. Head up here, right on Diddams Ln, left on Boundary St. Now be careful to not get run over. I just want you to look at the intersection in front of you. You'll be at the south-west tip of Centenary Place. it's that the most ridiculous intersection ? Brisbane wasn't very well planned.

Catch a cab and head back to your hotel, or walk around a bit more. Just remember there are perverts in Brisbane on Sunday nights.

You'll get more intimate with Brisbane tomorrow. Good night and sweet dreams 😘🌙✨

# Jour Trois

Get up and go get your free continental breakfast. Don't worry too much if the food is crap. It shouldn't be, should it ? Our first stop for the day is the GOMA _(Gallery of Modern Art)_. _(Don't you just love every museum or art gallery that ends in *-OMA* ? I do !_ 😊_)_

Wander gracefully the halls and don't forget to grab a map of the venue from the lovely lady at the front counter. It will help you around GOMA. It's an extensive venue.

I want you to pay special attention to the following areas:

- Anything by Cindy Sherman - _photography_
- Between May 20016-2017, the Anish Kapoor 'Untitled 2006-07' - _a sculpture_
- Australian Collection on Watermall Level - _all Australian art crap_
- The World Turns out on the grass area out fron of the bistro - _sculptures, on the grass with a firecracker sticking out ya ass (get the joke ? no ? boo !)_

Between 12noon and 15:00 the GONA Restaurant is open. You'll definitely need to make a booking in advance. This place is awesome, the food has been placed on the plate to make it look like art. Order the following:

- Entree: Moreton Bay bug, apple, almonds, beach greens, lilly pilly
- Mains: Wagyu, carrots, black garlic, spinach
- Dessert: Sheep's curd, rhubarb, roof top honey, elderflower

_(Note for the waitress - Don't Let Jake Fucking Change The Menu Choices I Have Made!!!)_

I don't know what kind of wine would be great to go following the wagyu but not ruin your palate for the dessert. You'll probably be best to ask the waitress _(Don't forget to tip your waitress. -Lafayette [True Blood])_.

Have you seen everything ? I hope so. Try to arrive at the GOMA Restaurant with at least 40 mins before closing time. I would even recommend you make your booking for 2pm and spend the last hour there in the intimacy of the venue allowing the end of the hour to mark the closing of the restaurant and our departure.

You should be feeling relaxed and invigorated by the art. Art is wonderful, enjoy it, soak it in, be inspired but don't walk away an art critique. Just let it flow over your mind and settle in deep.

It's time to get yourself on down to Coles _(or Woolworths) and stock up on some stuff. I prefer Coles because of FlyBuys. You're going to need the following items:

- Two breadsticks, medium length _(get it from Baker's Delight if you can, medium slice)_
- Cuccumber
- Cherry tomatoes
- Fresh lettuce greens _(loose leaf)_
- Cheese (Jarlesberg, from the service deli, 4 slices)_
- Some slices of cold meat, maybe smoked ham and spanish serrano ham
- Bottle of soda water
- TeeVee Snacks
- Serviettes
- Bottle of white wine
- Plastic cups
- Plastic party poppers
- Aerogard

Get back to your hotel room and put the stuff in the fridge. I hope the white wine was from either Adelaide Hills, New Zealand or France - they're the only respectable places when it comes to white wine.

Hollow out your two mini baguettes or cut them lengthwise. I don't particularly care what you do _(but I would like to know for future reference)_.

You'll be going on a picnic this evening. Hist ! Hark ! The night is very dark ! I do not know, but should not show, so hist ! Hist !


I think there's 107 steps. You need to get up there early as it's coming the winter months now and the sun sets readily. Time is so you have enough time from your room to the bottom of the steps and about a 20 min climb. It's not as easy as it sounds. 😁 You're heading to Kagaroo Points Cliff. I want you to sit on your arse, in the grass, make your sandwiches slowly and watch the sunset over the city. This is a vantage point often wasted without soaking in the true beauty from above and below. Watch as the light glistens in the glass on the tall structures before you. Do you realise all the people in these buildings are missing out - but they don't care ? Spend your time here peacefully. Sip your wine. Make your sandwiches. Take photos. Laugh a little. Laugh a lot. Watch in awe. Do you know the light you're seeing right now reflected took a minimum of 8 minutes to reach your eyes. The light rays have probably spent the last 100,000 years bouncing around in the outer layers of the sun, bouncing from surface to surface until finally breaking free and travelling all the way through space, past Mercury, Venus, the clouds and sky, finally smashing against the glass panes before you and scattering across the void into your eye in a colourful explosion of the spectrum. There, it remains absorbed and communicated to your brain by a series of neurons into an image that you see at the back of your head.

_(Now do you know why I didn't want to hit the back of your head that day? I wish forever to the day you die, you to see the beauty of the world we live.)_

Look up at the sky, see the blue ? Or do you see the dark coming of night ? It all depends on where you look. Behind up and over the hill from where you sit you should see the coming of night and afar the waning of day as the sun goes to rest for slumber.

Sit up and enjoy the rest of your wine. Have you sprayed yourself with Aerogard yet ? I don't want you go and get bitten by mosquitos or anything like that. Soon the dark will come and steal this day from you, and bring forth the bugs that bite your arms and neck. _(I want to softly bite your arms and neck)_.

Once the moon is either seen (or unseen) it's time to go. Get up and head back on down to your hotel. Tomorrow you're going somewhere else again. Take heed to my words, please don't rush off to a pub or something. It's not about the nightlife, it's all about capturing the prosperity of each moment you enjoy.

# Jour Quatre - Gold Coast

Spend the day at Wet'n'Wild. I can't instruct you any further as I don't know the Gold Coast better than this.

# Jour Sangt - Gold Coast

Spend the day at another theme park. The one with the Tower of Terror. Fly out to Sydney tomorrow morning.

# Jour Six - Sydney

Get off the plane at Domestic and head on down to the underground train station. You'll want to grab yourself an Opal card. Might I suggest you top it up with $30. I think the purchase price standard is $20, but ask them for an Opal card with $20. If they say "No", say back "No, darling. That's right. I want a th-irty-doll-ah-O-pell-card, k thnx." Then snap your fingers. Get the train and head to Central. You're going to your motel. I would recommend a backpackers if you can deal with it. Don't spend an amount of money on accomodation you don't need. There's one just outside of Central to the right. Well, Central is such a stupid shape you wouldn't know what that means. Head up to the main concourse and go out to the carpark. It's at 509 Pitt St and it's called "Wake Up Sydney Central". Full mainly of international travellers on working holiday visa's. Stay away from the French. They stink.

Have you had breakfast yet ? I presume not. Get your cash ready and head up George St until you reach the Galleries. As you cross Park St on the right you should see a long fucking line of people - police, lawyers, hippies, my ex-coworkers  _(if they listened to anything I ever said about good coffee)_ and any other city worker who knows good taste. Grab yourself a soy latte, no sugar, and anything you see upon the menu or in front of you. The muffins are divine. Pay the bitch. Don't ask her if it's a drug front and that's why they only take cash _(she's evil, she'll probably tell you to fuck off and then add you to her list of people to cast spells on at her cauldron at night)_. You've been warned!

Grab your coffee and muffin and head over the road to the building behind you. This is the QVB. Walk through the main entrance and just take a moment with each step to take in the grandeur of this place. I spent nearly every morning Mon-Fri here having coffee and complaining about my day ahead. If you're feeling peckish for later, stop by Zumbo's in the middle of the building _(it's on the same floor you are on)_ and grab a cake for takeaway. I can't recommend anything, because they're all nice. You pick what you want.

Once out the other side I hope you've try and remember if you saw the clock. If not, go back in and take any of the stairs to the next level. Walk until you are in front of that amazing timepiece. It's old. really old. And did you stop and stare at the central dome just after Zumbo's ? No. Well, I'm glad you're reading this before you go. Stop and stare at the dome above you in the centre - magnificent. History time ! There's a time  capsule up there somewhere that was laid by Queen Elizabeth II herself, but over time the records that told us where it was and all the people alive to remember have now forgotten and so it is gone. One day they may recover such a prize to share with the world.

Open your GPS and head to the Opera House. Become intimate with her my dear. Her father entrusted (her) to our hands from birth. The mother is that man you see to your right. That woman to your left. And those children that surround you. We are all her mother.

Go up to the gap between the sails, and touch her surface. It's smooth and scaly like a snake. Amazing. We'll become more intimate with her at a later stage. Pose with her and take photos of other people posing. Become part of history that is the lives of so many and make an impression that will last the tests of time.

Once you've finished here, walk off to the left and into the Botanical Gardens. This is my second most favourite spot in all of Sydney. Walk along the water and into the gardens themselves. Set yourself out to explore. Find a map and make your way to the Succulent Garden. Get yourself up and around to Mrs Macquaries Point before you depart. This is a wondrous sunset location. The sun sets behind the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, depending on which day you decide to go down and watch.

Head back toward to the city, it's time for lunch. I'm going to make you head back to a place in the heart of the city for lunch. It's a long walk. Don't complain. You'll be going to Encasa Deli. They're a Spanish based deli. Literally taken right out of the heart of any Spanish-speaking country and plomped smack-bang in the middle of Sydney. Get down there by 12, order anything with chorizo. You'll love it. Take a seat and enjoy. Don't forget to try their glorified softdrink called Inca Cola. Yummy !

Go down to Town Hall Station _(yes, I know we were just here this morning)_ and catch the train to Circular Quay. Get off and walk towards the Harbour Bridge this time. Veer off into The Rocks. I want you to take in everything you see in the main strip. On your right at some point you'll see the MoMA _(another -OMA venue !)_. You're nearing your destination. There's a gallery on the right. Walk in and ask for Tempest. She is my friend and will welcome you for a yarn. Enquire how she is and pass her my best wishes. I hope to see her again soon and one day maybe introduce you to her in person. Let her speak and listen, but don't just hear her - I mean really listen - this woman is wiser than words can capture and an icon in guiding me on my path without probably having ever realised.

Thank her for the time she's disposed to you and go over to the MoMA. Head up to the 3rd floor and to the cafe. Grab a glass of wine and sit on the balcony and look out across the water. Enjoy the view. Sip slowly biut gracefully.

Finish up here _(don't tip the waitress)_, and get ready to walk around The Rocks. Explore Dawes Point and just before you get to Hickson Road Reserve I want you to find this place:

{% img /images/jake_holiday/thelovers.jpg %}

Sit down there, and reflect on these words:

>Look at this my dear, is it not most beautiful thing you have seen ? There in his hand, was the photo he first saw of her before seeing her. It was then, he knew he would always share his heart with her for eternity. Not even the sight of the Opera House, in all her majesty, could distract her gaze from where his love was drawn.

The story behind this photo is unknown to any. Let me explain. The couple you see actually were looking at a photo of the two of them standing in front of the Opera House together. They met a while ago and took a photo of the two of them on their first date. He was reflecting on that day as he did today. Now, they are married. Well, they were married in the photo I took. Bless their cotton socks.

Continue on through. Find all the hidden lanes and let yourself get lost. Go into places and let yourself explore. We'll be heading back to the CBD again shortly for dinner and then back to the exact area you're standing, and I'll lead you to something magical when the night falls.

Get yourself back to Circular Quay around 6pm. If not already that time. Get on the train and go back to Town Hall. This time I want you to get above ground and go across the road. Behind KFC or around the side of KFC is a walkway. Go in. It's all Asian. Don't worry, they don't serve cat here _(sic.)_ Go down the escalators and you'll see a small shack-like shop - welcome to Miss Chu's. Say hello to Miss Chu and tell her "Miss Chu, I hungry !" If she doesn't laugh, she's not the real Miss Chu. Well, actually none of them are, but the one that represents Miss Chu will love you for it. Get whatever you want _(I recommend the duck entree thing, and the coconut slushies)_.

Go back to your place you're staying at, have a shower and change. Once all prepped up, walk up George St all the way to The Rocks again but swing a left on Argyle St. Walk up this steep road to the top. We're going to Observatory Hill Lookout. I hope you wore something warm. Didn't you ? Well, you're just stupid. 😜

Isn't Sydney beautiful ?

The sun sets off to the right, but I don't give a shit. That's not why I dragged you up here for. I want you to see the lovers future. See how the lights twinkle ? This, yes the twinkling, this my dear, what you see, is the burning fire between two lovers entwined for all eternity in passion that transcends heavens to the burning hells and beyond.

{% img /images/jake_holiday/2016-02-26_DJW.0504.800res.jpg 800 533 %}

I hope you're not worn out yet. You've got a lot more travelling to do tomorrow !

Get on down again to the walkway down below. From the International Terminal, you have the best vantage point of the Opera House at night. Wave her goodnight and blow a kiss. She needs to sleep. So do you !

Get back to your motel and get to bed. Goodnight Jake.

# Jour Sept - Sydney

Get up in the morning and make your way to Le Monde Cafe @ 83 Foveax St, Surry Hills. This place was rated as one Sydney's best coffee spots on Yelp! in 2015. Fancy, huh ?

Great. Now you're fed up and ready to go ? I hope so !

Today we're going to the Hornby Lighthouse. This place is honestly a bit of a shit to get to. I wanted to take you to Wedding Cake Rock, but I think I'll save that for when I travel with you to Sydney as you need to trek through open land, forests and beaches and to be brutally honest, I wouldn't trust you to not get hurt by way of a venomous snake or spider without the proper person _(moi)_ to guide you through the terrain. There are no maps of any kind that will guide you as the Govt. decided people shouldn't go there. That won't stop me bringing you there one day. They say that when lovers go together to Wedding Cake Rock, within a year they'll be married. _(giggle, OK, I just gave up my reason to want to take you there myself)_.

Get yourself to Circular Quay Station. From Le Monde I recommend going back to Central and catching the City Circle train. We're going to to this the easy way and catch a ferry to Watson's Bay.

Once off the ferry, head to your left along the beach until you reach a point where the beach no longer traverses the shore and you've got to head up a set of stairs. Don't swim in this water, it's gross. Pass down Cove St, right at Victoria St, left at Cliff St. Follow the trail in front of you around on the left side. High above you'll see a secluded beach at some point. Lady Bay Beach. This is for nudists. Stop and have a perve. Who doesn't. Keep walking and eventually you'll come across the Hornby Lighthouse.

[lighthouse pic]

Isn't she pretty ?

Head back the way you've come once you're finished here and we're going to Darling Harbour for lunch now. I'm sure you'll be hungry if you're not already by the time we get back.

One at Circular Quay, one again catch the train to Town Hall _(oh hai, Town Hall)_ and get on down to Darling Harbour. I recommend the most direct approach is to go down Pitt St and left at King St. At the end of King St is a walkway bridge that will gap the distance between you and amazing restaurants. Take your pic and sit where you like. Order, enjoy. But don't eat too much. I want you to get off your arse and head down to the Lindt Cafe whilst you're here. This is a special place for me. I used to go here all the time by myself and have coffee and chocolate. I've only ever been here myself with Jet once because she didn't know Sydney very well and so I showed her ALL the Lindt chocolates in one venue. Yummy !

Relax for a while.

From here walk down towards the path headed south until you reach the IMAX and Starbucks. Stop in and order a Grande soy latte, no sugar, and ask them to write your name as Ariana on there. No, she's not a drag queen ! 😚

Keep walking by and you'll see on your GPS the Chinese Friendship Garden. Pay the entry fee and sign the book. Write something special for me. Not to me, but something special to you, and do it as a favour for me. This goes to storage. Let it fall into history and memory. Spend your time here enjoying and see if you can't find the 12 Chinese Zodiac signs. They're hidden well !

One you finish up here it should be Friday which means the China Town Markets are on ! Whoop ! Whoop ! Navigate to Dixon St, and stop by all the stalls and marvel at the wonders. As you start to get hungry and it's closer to dinner time try something. I recommend the places with the longest lines around the middle of Dixon St where the cars sometimes drive. _(Unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of the place !)_

Save room for dessert. I've got something special lined up for you. Past the northern end of Dixon St head over the intersection to discover a congregation of Asians _(ni hao)_ around N2 - scientific for Nitrogen. I've never been here because I wanted to take someone who would appreciate this as much as I knew I would. So unfortunately as much as I would like to be there with you to enjoy this, you'll have to savour it and tell me about it another time. It's ice-cream ! But not just any ice-cream ! It's science ice-cream !

Once you're done here you can head over to Kings Cross. Might I suggest taking the train from Town Hall headed to Bondi. Every train from Town Hall will stop at Kings Cross.

It's not as scary as you think, don't worry, I'm not sending you into any imminent danger. Get out of the station _(it's deep underground but don't worry, there's long escalators)_ and head right. You'll walk all the way to the end where I'm going to ask you to cross to the middle of the road. Turn around and look up.

The Kings Cross Coke Sign. Yay !

Get back to the station and head to Circular Quay. Don't wander too far in any direction from where you are but more so directly back to the station. You're safe in this area unless someone who knows their shit is with you. I don't want you to get in harms way. I will take you one day through this area and show you amazing things.

Once back at Circular Quay, head around to the Opera House, and enjoy just the sounds and sights of people. You should notice an underground level as you approach the landmark ? Go down there.

Keep  walking until you come across Opera Bar. Stop in and try one of their cocktails. Do not hesitate to be a bit rough and push your way to the front. All the snobby people here are cunts. Light up a cigarette, stand as far to the edge as you can and enjoy your drink and let your ears fall on the conversations around you. Hear all the lost echoes in the sounds of travel, life, love and time. None of these people I can guarantee you will ever take life into their hands and hold it firmly. They just let go of the red balloon and defer it to fate. They failed to understand that fate is only what you let it be. Otherwise she has a cruel curse upon you and will just dangle the carrot. Once you're done, get back to your motel and have a peaceful sleep. Goodnight.

# Jour Huit

Get up! Get up! It's Saturday morning. Nobody has time to waste laying in bed all day. We have places to be and people to see. _(Do we really wanna see people ? Nah !)_ OK, that was a bit mean to wake you up so early. You must be tired. Sleep in until 10 then checkout. We're having brunch at my favourite spot in the whole of Sydney to kick off the last day. I want you get yourself down towards Oxford St and head on down. Might I suggest using your Opal card to take any bus headed for Bondi, Bronte or pretty much that comes through. You can get off at the stop we need and walk from there. It's a little hidden cafe run by two brothers. No, this time we don't need a reservation, but we want to try and get there before 11 when possible ! I'm taking you with these words to The Rusty Rabbit. Hidden deep in the sidestreets of Darlinghurst _(the haughty taughty gay area of Sydney)_ is a decrepit ugly building taken over by charm and elegance.

You'll need to get off at a bus stop most of the way up, and before the Anzac Road crossing. Cross over the main exit on the left and head on down. Use your GPS to walk yourself to: 252 Forbes St, Darlinghurst.

I don't need you to look at the menu. I just need you to trust me, explicitly. Pull the paper you prepared earlier in your pocket and read to them:

>I want, the Rusty Pancakes with ricotta, maple, mixed berries, passionfruit and pistachios. A warm latte, soy milk served in a takeaway cup. And to wash it all down a glass of water please. I will be sitting at this table waiting. Thank you.

They should laugh, because you should be smiling. Let your character be known as the melody heard by my ears each day.

Delicious. Wasn't it ?

Did you wonder why I wanted you to order the coffee in a takeaway cup ? Probably not, you'll find out why in a moment.

Hold the cup up against the backdrop of the cafe and take a photo with the rabbit facing you. Fancy, 'eh ? Post it to instagram. Be a lil' chic. Sassy !

Get up and head back out to the main strip, thank the staff and leave. You're now heading to where weddings are made. Further along the road is a hidden garden, sunken into the ground referred to as the Paddington (Sunken) Reservoir Gardens. It's totally hidden from sight. This is important because where you can actually see that beauty cannot be held in the eye, but only through bending of the light.

I know you can catch a bus to get here, but I want you to walk on the right side of the road and observe the shops on the left as you go past. On your right you will be passing a few funky stores, shops and bars. One of the funnest clubs on a Saturday night used to be here, but the society that rules Oxford St didn't support it well enough during the early times so it closed down. Up over an intersection somewhere ahead there should appear a fort wall of a kind. This is the old barracks. As you cross the sidestreet turn around behind you there's a 7-Eleven, and my old campus COFA behind that. Wave. Walk on by. Past the end of the barracks will be the Library and a small open plan park. Cross into the park and you'll see a bridge up on the far right in the corner. Step out onto it and look beneath you to see the hidden gem we've found. 

Scramble yourself down the stairway and influence yourself with this space. It may seem easy and simple, but see it from all angles, go out onto the road and try to see it again, find it's hidden architecture and enjoy the memories of love left her so many times as people start their journeys into each other. Wonderous, ain't it ?

It must be getting close to a time when we can depart soon and go explore the beach across the ocean. Get on any bus headed back towards the city and make your way to Circular Quay. I want you to get the Manly Ferry. It's the only ferry service that is MASSIVE and you tap on _(you don't tap off the other end)_. Once you get there, get through the hustle bustle that is surrounding you and across the street and into the mall.

Did you see that lighthouse across the bluff as you were out in the ocean to your right ? That's where I sent you yesterday. With the nudists and perverts. Love it.

Follow it to the other end. Here we have a beach that is truly beautiful and missed out by so many that live and die in this city as they travel just to the lowly Bondi. I'm not taking you to Bondi. It's a waste of your time. Explore the beach front. Did you wear thongs ? I entrust you to do so. Head to the right. Walk in the sand along the shore and let it touch your feet. Enjoy the sights and sounds of families, friends and foes. At the end of the beach you'll find a walkway. Travel along it and look beneath you from time to time to the rock pools, cemented pools, and the ocean. Isn't she majestic ? 

Following it to the end of the path you'll come across a small and secluded beach area and a restaurant on your right. To the right of said restaurant you'll see a walk way going up some stairs at first into a jungle. Follow it. Right to the top. On the right after you cross the bridge you'll see the stream of water falling from afar into the ocean with her own ecosystem.

Does this remind you not of the jungles in the northern west of Australia ? Don't worry, I'm not sending you where there be spiders. 😉

At the top it open out to a suburb. Step out onto the road and look back. Does this not remind you of the Reservoir Gardens, so much beauty hidden just under the covers, bend the light and you can see everything that there is to be held.

Head back on down now. The afternoon must be creeping back up on us now. I hope you've enjoyed walking so far. The restaurants down the bottom of the way can be bypassed, we're heading for the the hidden little restaurant behind the mall. Once you're back at the beach follow it down until you can see Wentworth St. Head down and on the right there an opening which is well secluded. You might need their phone number. It's (02) 9977 1777. You're looking for Fishmongers Manly. Head on in, place your order, take a beer and discover a table. Try for outside in their eating area. I can personally vouch for this place with 5 stars. I hope you like seafood and don't complain.

Once you've finished eating pack up and go back to the wharf. We're heading back for Sydney. Try to push you way to the front of line to get on the boat. Get yourself a front row seat. It's important because as you sail into Sydney you can see the sun at a low angle against the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. It should be close to sunset now.

Once back at Circular Quay, I want you to walk up to the Opera House one more time, and go see her up close, say your goodbye and wish her well. Don't forget to blow a kiss to Australia's adopted daughter.

Get yourself back to Darling Harbour now. We're going to get the best vantage point so you can watch the fireworks. Got your camera ready ?

Standing on the intersection of the Western Distributor Freeway and Sussess St, see where the people disappear as they cross the road. Follow them. Go up onto that long ramp and navigate the high road.

As you come to the end you'll see a set of elevator doors. Just before the walkway splits you should see a stairwell _(almost secluded)_ to you right. Get up there and walk out until your half way in the harbour of view. See all those other weirdos ? They know this secret too, but too secret to share. Fireworks start at 8pm, and the quickest way back from Circular Quay is the train on Platform 1 that should pass through Town Hall. Get off here and take Exit 1. Go out and immediately turn right and around the gates. Go into Woolworths and head above ground. Out front of Woolworths cross the road and down the road along side of KFC until you reach Sussex St and then turn left until you reach the Western Distributor Freeway on your right. You'll know where you are because you'll see a plethora of motorbikes and vespas on your right and hear the gay anthems cranking from Madonna's gym on the left.

Sit tight and wait for the fireworks to start.

After the show, I want you to go back to your hotel and grab your bag. We're going to catch the last flight out of Sydney so you can start fresh in Melbourne, ready for tomorrow. Bon voyage Sydney, we're off to the airport.

You will be missed, but not forgotten. 

# Jour Neuf - Melbourne

You'll arrive in Melbourne the night before, so get your bag and head to your hotel. They have busses that take you from the airport directly to the city.

Melbourne was my home for a part of my life and therefor shares a special place in my heart where the sign above the door simply says "Home".

Between Dendy St and Were St is our first destination after breakfast. This is where you can find the iconic Brighton Bathing Houses.

[brighton beach houses]

But first, let's get you fed. Melbourne is the most cultured city in all of Australia, and honestly if I were to ever leave Adelaide, I would hope that it would be with someone who wanted to settle in Melbourne above all - this is the sister city to Adelaide that we often forget.

Get yourself on to Manchester Press. It's down a laneway off Little Bourke St. Grab a coffee, ask for something cool on your latte art, anything with the word 'bagel' in the title and a table for yourself. This place is amazing.

Fed and fat, get yourself directions from someone. I'm not going to tell you where to go, because Melbourne is nice like that. Everyone will either help or not know. I do hope you didn't ever need to ask for directions in Sydney. They probably gave you the wrong way, or the long way. Everyone there is rude or only out for whatever they can get. Don't trust them. The only person I sent you do, was Tempest, because she is very dear to me and I trust you in her time, as her time in yours.

Head down to Brighton Beach front and get your camera ready. Sadly, in all the time I spent in Melbourne, which I do believe was longer than 6 months, I never went to see these amazing pieces of art.

This day is going to be lazy, I've been working you hard so far.

Gather around on the beach and enjoy your time here. I know you love the water, so I'll be asking you to follow these words to another amazing spot this afternoon. There's no rush. Explore the area quietly and rest in the sand. Walk along and listen to your music. Think about your life and where you want to go. Look up at sky. Can you see the stars ? No, of course not, the sun hides them from us, but they're still there. Starlight and sunlight is beaming down to you at the moment. All the great vibrance of our sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, daughters and sons from lives come and gone and touching down on you. Guiding you. What do you hear ? Don't usher a word. Keep it close and let it stay with you, and you alone.

Once you start to crave lunch I would recommend you head up to a place called Monk Bodhi Dharma. You should be able to catch a tram from Brighton Beach to within 500m walking distance. It's not far.

THe address is 202 Carlisle St, Balaclava (03) 9534 7250 _(yes, the irony, I know - the word Carlisle has come back to haunt me !)_. Although this is a vegetarian restaurant, it's amazing.

Plan the rest of your day to relax and just walk around. As the sun starts to set I need you to get yourself to the following address:
 
2 Pier St, Port Melbourne

You'll understand why when you're there. The magic words, BEFORE the sun starts to set.

For dinner, you'll be taking yourself up to Hunky Dory - 181 Bay St, Port Melbourne. What would end a perfect day other than fish & chips. Heck, you might even want to take the food from this place with you down to the Pier to enjoy your food over the sunset. Just make sure you have your camera and I know you'll use your manners when you ask people to take photos of you against the backdrop. Try to take one of your sad pose photos. They're incredible. So powerful an image. 

Afterwards, get back to your hotel and enjoy a long hot shower.


# Jour Dix - Melbourne

Today we need to explore the hub of culture that arose from an underground society and bloomed like a rose out to show us it's own flair - Chapel St. I'm not going to tell you where to go or what to do. Find your own way around. Start your day here with a cafe and go in and out of any shop; even if you don't want anything - just explore.

Be sure that by the time lunch rolls around you've fed yourself and seen everything that caught your eye. Don't forget to talk to the locals.

In the afternoon head over to the Flinders St Station and the Federation Square. Take some moments to observe it from every angle you can find. Both of them. They are one and the same in the heart of the CBD.

As you soak it all in, think of all the people that worked hard to bring you these structures, modern and old, together and facing one another like a mirror of achievements.

>What we see now is but a dim image in a mirror, soon we shall see face to face.

Head on into the ACMI hidden in behind Federation Square. Whatever they've got going on in there is surely worth a visit. It's what Melbourne is all about.

When you finish up get yourself over to the Botanic Gardens _(if you haven't worked it out yet, I love gardens)_.  Go through these gardens peacefully and take all of the smells and sights in.

_(Just a side note, Melbourne is difficult to write about because so much has change since I last visited there. I wish I could re-explore it again and show you all these wonderful things and discover new points of interest with you.)_

Go grab something for dinner when you're ready near the Star City Casino. If your hotel is along the way then stop in there to change your shoes and dress. Put something a bit fancy on and get ready to blow $50. Physically take $50 with you, no more. 

After dinner, head on in, and spend $1 here and $2 there. Try a new game you've never quipped your hand at before. Lose or win it's all in the spirit of fun and holiday. Don't give in to anything. Risk is your maiden and she will play your hand to her best turn.

Spend some time after the casino just walking around the city and feel it. Simply, just feel it. When you're feet start to tire take yourself back to your hotel and your bed. I'm sorry I can't be there to rub them for you. I would gladly. I love your feet.

>When I ask myself to picture myself happy, I can see a future that involves a couch as your legs lay across me and I'm rubbing those feet and legs.

Tomorrow we only have 2 last stops before the flight back to Adelaide.

Goodnight and sweet dreams, my dear.

# Jour 11 - Melbourne

Breakfast head on to The Grain Store (03) 9972 6993 @ 517 Flinders St, Melbourne. Their speciality is eggs. So I'm sure you'll find something they have to offer just to your particular taste.

Today I want you to spend some time letting yourself become intimate with Melbourne in your own way. Find your own lunch and find your own dinner. Make your own history and stories. See if you can't find the grafitti laneway and snap a few selfies and shots. Surprise me. Surprise the world. Surprise yourself. Take a moment to live in a world like I do, and get lost, then find yourself, and then lose the society.

After dinner I recommend you find the giant clown mouth that is Luna Park.

Go on the rides. Eat fairy floss. Ask them to crank up the speed. Make yourself almost sick. Glorious !

Once you've had enough, make your way to the airport, you're bound for Adelaide.

I'll meet you at the airport and bring you to bed and warm cuddles. Don't worry, I'm not hijacking your holiday. I'm hijacking you. 😘





# Jour 12 - Adelaide

Wake up and kiss me good morning. Get dressed, and head out. You're on your way to see some amazing things today.

You'll be headed to the hills

# Jour 13 - Adelaide

# Jour 14 - Home

Spend the day at home and just relax. Don't do anything. I'll come over and give you head rubs, hand rubs, leg rubs, and all kinds of rubs. 😉
