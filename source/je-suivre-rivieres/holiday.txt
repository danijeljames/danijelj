The holiday for a fortnight must start at the end of a work week (Friday) and end on the Sunday preceding the day before work. The adjustment period should be minimal and resume normal life as it transitions naturally.


# Jour Un
Leaving Friday after work, head to the airport and take off for Alice Springs. Go grab your hire care that you prepped ahead of time and get to your motel. Don't worry about staying somewhere comfortable. It's not important. It's just where you're gonna be for the night.

Get up early in the morning. Really early. It's holiday time but it's no time to be lazy, it's Saturday morning and it's your first day. Get in your car and drive to GPS co-ordinates *25°19'47.3"S 130°57'17.4"E*. Make sure you bring your coffee and vegemite toast. You'll be need to be here at no later than 6:30am. Pull over and have your camera ready, you're about to see some magic happen from the East. I hope it's a clouded, but not overcast, morning.

Once you've soaked up all the beauty you can handle, get back in the car and drive back around the front entrance of the monolith and climb it. _(I hope your ate breakfast like I told you to !)_ You'd expect to be up the top and singing the book by about 11am latest. If not, you're lazy.

Get on down, back in your car and head to Hanuman Alice Springs. Don't complain. _(Don't complain, I'm choosing where you're going.)_

Earth Sanctuary World Nature Centre is where you'll be heading this evening. So maybe have some down time and walk around, enjoy a glass. Go to the Anzac Hill lookout. Just don't overwork yourself.

I hope you read this ahead of time, now you should have made a booking with the aforementioned venue. _(Their phone number is *08 8953 6161*, in case your need it!)_ Meet up with the rest of the folk and go out exploring the stars. See the jewels spread across the sky. Spend your time in awe and capturing the beauty of the heavens shining down on you. Do you remember ? Remember when you were made of the same stuff as I ? Were were once stardust my dear. We come from dust and return to dust - in the heart of stars eternally.

After the show head back to your motel for the night. You're gonna be packing up and starting Jour Duex soon.

# Jour Deux
Take the car back to the airport and get ready. You're about to head off again. Are you wearing fresh underwear ? I hope so ! 😜

Today you're departing or Brisbane. One you get there catch the train to the city. You'll need to grab a Brisbane GO card. Much like the SA transport care _(that I keep calling an Opal card)_ except it's better. Have you had anything to eat yet ? Of course not. Don't be stupid. I know you. Once you get to town the first stop is going to be finding a little laneway called *Little Burnett Lane*. There's a cafe here. _(Do you trust me ? I hope so. I trust these words. Hell, I'm the architect here !)_

_(So, I was listening to Meat Loaf's - You Took The Words Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night) as I wrote this next part, so I felt it perfect that I adapt it for you here:)_

I'm imagining you've found the place yet ? No ? Well hurry along. You're supposed to be standing at BREW now. Grab your menu and start licking your lips.

_(queue backing track)_

You were licking your lips,
and your chapstick shining.
You were dying just to ask for coffee.
You're just standing there in a laneway shop
by the story I told you.
You now there's not another moment,
not another moment,
not another moment to waste

You hold the menu close that your eyes grow wide.
But your tongue is licking all over your lips.
You're trying to speak
But not matter what you do
You just can't seem to decide.

And so, let me take the words right out of your mouth and write them here. 😉

Order:

- Avocado on Toast add Egg - _w/ goats cheese ricotta mousse, fresh lemon_
- Large soy latte, no sugar
- Small bottle of sparkling water

Take your seat in the laneway and have them bring it out to you. You're on holiday. I hope you're camera is ready, take a happy snap and upload it to Instagram _(insert Anjelah Johnson saying "Sir don't lie, I can see..." quote here about not having instagram; yeah, I saw you liked a photo_ 😘_)_

Finish up your brunch. Feel full ? Good. We should be near midday now. I want you to get your way around to Roma Street Parkland. It's a beautiful park in the heart of Spring Hill _(or is it on the edge ?)_. We're going to take a walk around the 16 hectares of beautiful park and soak it all in.

Don't worry about not knowing where you're going. I'll add maps to this when it's finished.

I want you to particularly walk slowly through the Spectacle Garden. This is mostly important as the work put into this ensures that any visitor has something to see and smell at all times of the year. I'm bringing you here because it doesn't matter when you come, you'll be sure to see colours born of hearth.

Sift around the rest of the gardens and don't hesitate to take a pen and paper from your bag and write a wish on there. Just one wish. Try for something simple and sweet. Anything you want. Find the most beautiful flower you can by sight and smell. Do you remember that wish ? I want you to bury the paper right under the plant the flower so does bloom from. Thank the flower and be on your way. It's time for getting to the motel and you'll probably need a shower and to relax a bit.

Yes, I did say "chapstick" up earlier. I hope you're drinking plenty of water, wear sunscreen and have chapstick on. Preferably Burt's Bees Wax. The one with mint. It's sassy (like you) !

Dinner is your next stop, and I'm assuming it's late in the afternoon now.

You'll be heading to a place called Blackbird Bar & Grill. They are a relative newcomer to the Eagle Street Pier dining precinct, _(so many metaphors to reference here, I shall stick to my story and stop diverting)_. Make sure you've booked ahead of time.

Their phone number is (07) 3229 1200 and you'll get to them at 123 Eagle St, Brisbane. They're in the Riverside Centre.

Honestly you don't even need to know what you're picking from the menu. Everything, and I mean this, is amazing. Ask your waitress to pick something for you based on what you don't eat, that way you can leave her open to opportunities. Let it be a surprise. You're on holidays anyway. Maybe pick a glass of New Zealand white from their menu. I want you to stay sober, so don't drink more than a glass. Wash it down with a glass of water and then head to the bar. You're in Brisbane bitch, it's time to crack out the cocktails. Yep ! I've brought you to a fucking amazing cocktail bar. Pick any two items from the menu _(except for an espresso martini, this isn't Sydney)_ and savour ever drop of flavour from the glass.

_(Side note, did you know that glass is the only chalice that lets you taste as close to origin unless you use crystal! So for this reason, it was more commonly acceptable to say "transparent like glass" because crystal was out of reach from common folk!)_

Don't stay for more than 2 drinks. That's all you need. We're going to head off for a walk along the banks of the river up north as you watch the lights dance over the beating stream. Soon you'll have Macrossan St on your left. Head up here, right on Diddams Ln, left on Boundary St. Now be careful to not get run over. I just want you to look at the intersection in front of you. You'll be at the south-west tip of Centenary Place. it's that the most ridiculous intersection ? Brisbane wasn't very well planned.

Catch a cab and head back to your hotel, or walk around a bit more. Just remember there are perverts in Brisbane on Sunday nights.

You'll get more intimate with Brisbane tomorrow. Good night and sweet dreams 😘🌙✨

# Jour Trois
Get up and go get your free continental breakfast. Don't worry too much if the food is crap. It shouldn't be, should it ? Our first stop for the day is the GOMA _(Gallery of Modern Art)_. _(Don't you just love every museum or art gallery that ends in *-OMA* ? I do !_ 😊_)_

Wander gracefully the halls and don't forget to grab a map of the venue from the lovely lady at the front counter. It will help you around GOMA. It's an extensive venue.

I want you to pay special attention to the following areas:

- Anything by Cindy Sherman - _photography_
- Between May 20016-2017, the Anish Kapoor 'Untitled 2006-07' - _a sculpture_
- Australian Collection on Watermall Level - _all Australian art crap_
- The World Turns out on the grass area out fron of the bistro - _sculptures, on the grass with a firecracker sticking out ya ass (get the joke ? no ? boo !)_

Between 12noon and 15:00 the GONA Restaurant is open. You'll definitely need to make a booking in advance. This place is awesome, the food has been placed on the plate to make it look like art. Order the following:

- Entree: Moreton Bay bug, apple, almonds, beach greens, lilly pilly
- Mains: Wagyu, carrots, black garlic, spinach
- Dessert: Sheep's curd, rhubarb, roof top honey, elderflower

_(Note for the waitress - Don't Let Jake Fucking Change The Menu Choices I Have Made!!!)_

I don't know what kind of wine would be great to go following the wagyu but not ruin your palate for the dessert. You'll probably be best to ask the waitress _(Don't forget to tip your waitress. -Lafayette [True Blood])_.

Have you seen everything ? I hope so. Try to arrive at the GOMA Restaurant with at least 40 mins before closing time. I would even recommend you make your booking for 2pm and spend the last hour there in the intimacy of the venue allowing the end of the hour to mark the closing of the restaurant and our departure.

You should be feeling relaxed and invigorated by the art. Art is wonderful, enjoy it, soak it in, be inspired but don't walk away an art critique. Just let it flow over your mind and settle in deep.

It's time to get yourself on down to Coles _(or Woolworths) and stock up on some stuff. I prefer Coles because of FlyBuys. You're going to need the following items:

- Two breadsticks, medium length _(get it from Baker's Delight if you can, medium slice)_
- Cuccumber
- Cherry tomatoes
- Fresh lettuce greens _(loose leaf)_
- Cheese (Jarlesberg, from the service deli, 4 slices)_
- Some slices of cold meat, maybe smoked ham and spanish serrano ham
- Bottle of soda water
- TeeVee Snacks
- Serviettes
- Bottle of white wine
- Plastic cups
- Plastic party poppers
- Aerogard

Get back to your hotel room and put the stuff in the fridge. I hope the white wine was from either Adelaide Hills, New Zealand or France - they're the only respectable places when it comes to white wine.

Hollow out your two mini baguettes or cut them lengthwise. I don't particularly care what you do _(but I would like to know for future reference)_.

You'll be going on a picnic this evening. Hist ! Hark ! The night is very dark ! I do not know, but should not show, so hist ! Hist !


I think there's 107 steps. You need to get up there early as it's coming the winter months now and the sun sets readily. Time is so you have enough time from your room to the bottom of the steps and about a 20 min climb. It's not as easy as it sounds. 😁 You're heading to Kagaroo Points Cliff. I want you to sit on your arse, in the grass, make your sandwiches slowly and watch the sunset over the city. This is a vantage point often wasted without soaking in the true beauty from above and below. Watch as the light glistens in the glass on the tall structures before you. Do you realise all the people in these buildings are missing out - but they don't care ? Spend your time here peacefully. Sip your wine. Make your sandwiches. Take photos. Laugh a little. Laugh a lot. Watch in awe. Do you know the light you're seeing right now reflected took a minimum of 8 minutes to reach your eyes. The light rays have probably spent the last 100,000 years bouncing around in the outer layers of the sun, bouncing from surface to surface until finally breaking free and travelling all the way through space, past Mercury, Venus, the clouds and sky, finally smashing against the glass panes before you and scattering across the void into your eye in a colourful explosion of the spectrum. There, it remains absorbed and communicated to your brain by a series of neurons into an image that you see at the back of your head.

_(Now do you know why I didn't want to hit the back of your head that day? I wish forever to the day you die, you to see the beauty of the world we live.)_

Look up at the sky, see the blue ? Or do you see the dark coming of night ? It all depends on where you look. Behind up and over the hill from where you sit you should see the coming of night and afar the waning of day as the sun goes to rest for slumber.

Sit up and enjoy the rest of your wine. Have you sprayed yourself with Aerogard yet ? I don't want you go and get bitten by mosquitos or anything like that. Soon the dark will come and steal this day from you, and bring forth the bugs that bite your arms and neck. _(I want to softly bite your arms and neck)_.

Once the moon is either seen (or unseen) it's time to go. Get up and head back on down to your hotel. Tomorrow you're going somewhere else again. Take heed to my words, please don't rush off to a pub or something. It's not about the nightlife, it's all about capturing the prosperity of each moment you enjoy.

# Jour Quatre






Thursday
Observatory Hill, the sun sets off to the right, but I don't give a shit. That's not why I dragged you up here for. I want you to see the lovers future. See how the lights twinkle ? This, yes the twinkling, this my dear, what you see, is the burning fire between two lovers entwined for all eternity in passion that transcends heavens to the burning hells and beyond.
