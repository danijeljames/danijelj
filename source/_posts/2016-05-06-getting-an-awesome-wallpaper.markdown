Having made a promise that I would go back and get a photograph of the sunrise to make a wallpaper for the [iPhone 6S Plus](http://www.apple.com/au/shop/buy-iphone/iphone6s), I finally got back up to [Mount Lofty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lofty) this morning and managed to capture some interesting shots.

Unfortunately I didn't think to bring my other lenses with me when I came up here so I was limited to my [18-55mm](https://www.canon.com.au/en-AU/Personal/Support-Help/Product-Help/Camera-Accessories/Camera-Lenses/EF-S%2018-55mm%20f35-56%20IS%20II) lens, but managed to capture some nice shots.

The sun comes up pretty quickly too ! Honestly, it's not there one moment, then suddenly she's peeping her head over the horizon and then...
