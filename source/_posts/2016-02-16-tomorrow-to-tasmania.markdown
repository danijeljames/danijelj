Tomorrow I'm headed to Tasmania to join Grenouille üê∏. I don't know how I ever agreed to this wild adventure, but I'm sure it's gonna be crazy and most probably full of awesome opportunities to capture the essence that is Tasmania.

I really should be going to sleep soon but I figured sitting here that I can quickly dart across the road to McDonald's and grab a chocolate sundae before laying down to sleep.

I expect there to be some amazing shots available on this island!
