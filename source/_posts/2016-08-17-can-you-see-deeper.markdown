Simply looking down, it's a shopping trolley. With few ingredients. Ricotta, cheese, pasta, broccolini, bread crumbs, milk, celery, and a few other things. It's really so simple, but is it? Can you see deeper into this image?

It's our shopping trolley. It's out life. If I told you this is only something simple, it's this moment, that we are here in the name of love, would you see deeper? It's just today. It's just this moment. We're doing our shopping, together. Ever seen your parents shopping together? Or young couples who've maybe just started their life together? Or how about and old couple with more wrinkles than you can count on your fingers and toes?

I present to you here, one of my most favourable photos from the time we've spent together. Here and now, today, we are shopping for our groceries - together. We've decided on meals for a week ahead, convened, agreed, argued, and resolved. Then moved forward.

The act of grocery shopping in itself is quite simple. It's no more than an action of survival at the base of it all. Nothing more, nothing less. An action to plan out a survival plan to nourish our bodies so we can seemingly pass through another period of time. Weekly, monthly, fortnightly? How often do you shop? Do you shop? Are you shopping for yourself, your partner, your family, your friend? Anyone at all?

We're about to embark on an adventure between the two of us as we move through another period of transition. Bringing the aspect of weekly meals from separation into a single unified action. Sometimes I cook, sometimes Jake cooks.

Did I write about earlier my blue recipie book? Maybe not. I don't remember all the articles in this blog and what I spoke out from time to time, so I can forget where I'm up to!

TL;DR - When I decided Jake was the person I'd be spending the rest of my life with, I went out and bought a blue feint lined Moleskin book. Here was to be the recipes that celebrated the history of our life together. From all my experience so far, I had the tools I needed to bring joy to Jake's life through food. Sometimes I'm wondering what I'm really good at. Is it just making breakfast in bed with a kiss on his forehead? Or is it the warm chicken and sweet corn soup _(with special ingredients he would kill me if he found out were in there)_ when Jake isn't feeling well, so he gets better soon? I don't know. I just know that for many years I've never fully embraced the kitchen, whether it was a lack of interest or a lack of ambition - but now I feel home is in the kitchen when I know that I'll be making us a meal to share.

But I don't bake. That is solely Jake's forte. My baking skills are limited to setting the fire alarm off and everyone needing to evacuate the building.

The next time you go grocery shopping, stop for a moment and look into your basket, trolley, bag - whatever! Look at it, and see where you really are in life, where you're going, and what you're doing. Don't miss the small things because they are parts of a much greater image.

A jigsaw cannot be complete if you miss 1 piece.
