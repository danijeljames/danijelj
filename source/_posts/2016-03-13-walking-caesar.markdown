It's 27¬∞C and C√¶sar üê∂ is at the back door slobbering all over the glass. He's just been given a new choke-chain this arvo by my mum 'cos he is a pretty big dog and can't be handled easily without some restraint. I've decided to bring him down to the local dog park or "Pooch Park" as it's colloquially known.

We get down there after I drove him in the car Ante gave me, and he's slobbered all over my windows too, and off we go. A short run around the park and sniff and scratch we go for a walk down under the bridge and along the river front
