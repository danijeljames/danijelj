It's 27°C and Cæsar 🐶 is at the back door slobbering all over the glass. He's just been given a new choke-chain this arvo by my mum 'cos he is a pretty big dog and can't be handled easily without some restraint. I've decided to bring him down to the local dog park or "Pooch Park" as it's colloquially known.

We get down there after I drove him in the car Ante _(the youngest of us 3 boys)_ gave me, and Cæsar's 🐶 somehow slobbered all over my windows at this point, so out the car and off we go. A short run around the park and sniff and scratch we go for a walk down under the bridge and along the river front
