Today I met Ralf, Jake's dog since he was a kid. Ralf is 9 years old now :-)

I know they belong together because they both have the same attitude and facials. Could you ask for anymore proof that a dog resembles its' master ?

Apart from the kind nature of this [Shar Pei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shar_Pei), I cannot fathom what makes him just so adorable ! All I know, is Jake loves him and that touches me softly.
