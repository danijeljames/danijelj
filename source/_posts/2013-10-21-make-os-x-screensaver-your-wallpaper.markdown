If you have a fancy screensaver and you want to see it all the time, use then all you need to do is run the following command in Terminal (Applications/Utilities) and it will automatically set the current screensaver to your wallpaper:

    /System/Library/Frameworks/Screensaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background

Then press enter and voila! If it doesnâ€™t work for you right away, you may need to restart your Mac.
