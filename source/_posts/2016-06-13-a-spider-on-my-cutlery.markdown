Does the saying go _"Waiter, there's a spider in my soup"_ or _"Ma'am, there's a spider on my cutlery"_? I always thought it was the former, no ?

We went this morning for breakfast to [Swedish Tarts](https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/swedish-tarts-semaphore) for crÃªpes, what else? Well, in short, bad service, a messed up order, spiders on our cutlery, hair on our crÃªpes, aged berries, and coffee served wrong. ðŸ˜¡ It wasn't a great experience.

We've been here before for breakfast once, and Jake was just here not yesterday to pick up coffee for us to have with our homemade breakfast - so what happened today? I can't say that I was even slightly delighted at the whole experience. Though the food does look amazing, I dare say.

So the presentation of these images can save the day. I won't bore you with the finer details of what happened, but we got a refund on one of the crÃªpes _(the one with the hair on it)_ but Jake didn't feel like really eating after that. ðŸ˜”

So we took a selfie.

What really annoyed me the most about this whole situation was my coffee wasn't served in a takeaway cup and the lady serving me was more interested in telling me about their three store locations so I didn't have to come out all this way just to get it in a takeaway cup...I still wanted it in a takeaway cup, luv!

To rectify this Jake brought me to a place called [The Red Mill CaffÃ©](http://theredmillbakehouse.com.au) and saved the day. Yay. Great little place. Can't wait to write up my review on [Yelp!](https://www.yelp.com.au/)
