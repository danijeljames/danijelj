Today is 3rd March and therefor marks the birthday of my oldest and dear friend Mike Amu (üê†) !

We caught up for breakfast this morning at a cafe in the Westfield building on Pitt St Mall on Level 5. There we had our usual share of coffee and cake before heading off to our daily rituals of meetings and work.

It's so important to remember the important people in your life, the ones that have stayed there for a long time and don't move away from you heart - regardless of the distance. Michael and I have shared an enormous amount of love, joy, tears, lonliness, anger, fun, business, travel and so much more over the years. Next week is his birthday party which I will be flying back to Sydney for. The theme is masquerade which I'll be hanging out for, and we have a special guest performer !

I remember the first time I met Michael back when I was 20, and barely an adult myself. From that day forward, in the book that is my memories I began a new life on a road to self discovery and learning. Michael has been instrumental in my advancements as a person and as Danijel. I don't know how my life would have ended up if he hadn't crossed paths with me and I still share a special place in my heart for him.

So take the time to remember the people you love, you don't need to be in _love_ with them, but remember them for who they are, what they do, and where your life has intersected with theirs. Ripples across a pond start with just one stone!
