Tasmania has got to be one of the worst places for hospitality in all of Australia. Never more often in my life have I happily gone on to Yelp! to write a bad review about venue as through our travel of Tasmania. It's disgusting. What happened to the good framework that this country was built upon? My travelling companion Grenouille (üê∏), may not have been able to understand the dymanics of the situation that played out at hand but I certainly did!

I arrived at [Hobart Internaitional Airport](!www.hotbartinternational.com.au) and was taken back at how small this place was. Really? This is an international travel destination? It's not even half the size of the old Adelaide International Airport before it was revamped a few years ago. Weird.

First messages from Grenouille were more than welcome until I was told the car licence was forgot and left behind. LOL! Double LOL! So back he went and I resorted to my UK licence. Yes, scary as it may be for a lot of people, I do have a valid international licence and it won't be taken away from me. Yet. üòù

Thank you for the welcome at [RedSpot](!www.redspot.com.au), your assistance was amazing! 5-Star!

Bringing it down to a brief outline, we travelled on day 1 _(jour un)_ to 

Day 3 _(jour trois)_ Grenouille and I went to [Sea Life Centre](!www.yelp.com.au/biz/sea-life-centre-bicheno) and wow! That's all I can say. Not a good _wow_ like [Lydia](!youtu.be/Z5C6vd3blq0) gives, a REALLY bad kind of _Wow!_. What the fuck was wrong with these people? The menu has been translated to English and yet you treat your Asian customers with a direct sense of distain and contempt! I don't know what allowed me to sit silently and watch, I wanted to butt in but the family of three conceeded to take a seat at a different table than the one they wanted.

There was a language barrier, I admit that, but the family only asked if they could have that table by the window - and you agreed. So why didn't you just sit them down at the table and clear it for them? Honestly the amount of time you spent berrating that poor family and sitting on the couches before they could have the table because you had to clear it wasn't all that bad, was it? I've been to many a restaurant and been sat at the table and had someone clear it quickly. All you had to do was put down 3 small plates, forks, knives and serviettes. Clearly it was an obstacle or you just really hate that family? I don't know.

Anyway, on behalf of that family, I'd like to extend a really big and warm "Fuck you, Sea Life Centre! Fuck you and your shitty service and treating people like children!"

If you don't want to be nice to Asian people, don't have a fucking Asian translated menu. In fact, don't serve me. Don't serve the other patrons. Don't serve anyone. Get on a boat and fuck off down to Antartica. Let a polar bear eat you, or something.

In short - don't eat at the following places until they improve their customer service to a standard:

- Pancake &amp; Crepe Shop
- Sea Life Centre

Everywhere else is OK üòâ
