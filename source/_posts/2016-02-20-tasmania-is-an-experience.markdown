Sitting on my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, QF77, retrospectivey I have mixed emotions about the hospitality of people from Tasmania. In this hand it had to be one of the worst places for anyone to experience a welcome in all of Australia. And that includes Sydney. Disgusting. What happened to the good framework that this country was built upon? My travelling companion Grenouille (üê∏), may not have been able to understand the dymanics of three particular situations that played out at hand but I certainly did! On the other hand we were greeted like a lost stranger that had a reservation waiting to be fulfilled.

I arrived at [Hobart Internaitional Airport](!www.hotbartinternational.com.au) and was taken back at how small this place was. Really? This is an international travel destination? It's not even half the size of the old Adelaide International Airport before it was revamped a few years ago. Weird.

Getting off the plane my first messages from Grenouille warm and fuzzy until I was told the car licence was forgot and left behind. LOL! Double LOL! So Grenouille went back towards his place of stay and I resorted to my UK licence. Yes, scary as it may be for a lot of people, I do have a valid international licence and it won't be taken away from me. Yet. üòù

First up was Thank you for the welcome at [RedSpot](!www.redspot.com.au), your assistance was amazing! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è You were friendly, welcoming, and extremely helpful. I would just like to mention you with a shout-out here on my blog. Thank you! üëçüèª

Bringing it right down to a shorter post, we travelled around Tasmania on Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi and Samedi.

#####Day 1 Wednesday _(jour un mercredi)_

######Sorell Fruit Farm
Amazing little farm a short stint out of Hobart. Bit annoyed that we couldn't go into the farm with just a single bucket between the two of us. We didn't really need two buckets _(large punnets)_ between us to collect 3 apples, 2 pears and a handful of strawberries. Was fun! Grenouille couldn't pick a strawberry to save a life, but decided to steal mine to make the punnet look nice and plump. Pears were small but juicy. Nashi pears to be exact. Apples were yellow-ish in colour but nice. Strawberries were almost all gone but having worked on the Beerenberg Farm myself a few years back I knew how to pick them. The staff were a bit touchy with some of the Asian tourists who just wanted to walk around the orchards to look whilst one of them picked them. So they too were forced to buy a bucket each. Maybe they could fix this business model?

######Tasmanian Devil Park
This was a little bit of a disappointment. It's the Tasmanian Devil Park Unzoo. It's not a "zoo" per se, but they help in the breeding and conservation of the Tasmanian Devil. Unbeknown to most, the Tasmanian Devil suffers from a cancer that is transmitted by blood - much like the HIV virus. And also like the HIV virus, we don't know where it came from _(the cancer)_. My favourite part was going out to the Kangaroos to play, watching Quolls devour an animal carcass and the feeding of the Tasmanian Devil. So voracious! Both of them! Who ever thought a Quoll was such a savage eater! üò∞

######Eaglehawk Neck Historic Site
Eaglehawk Neck had some natural formations that really take a moment to let sink into the mind. The Tessellated Pavement Slate Reserve down on the beach shore looked like tiles laid by man from above, upon closer inspection we reaslised it was natural formations from erosion of the stone over years from the ocean.

######Coal Mines
I didn't take my camera with me, so I have no real images of this place. It's a long walk of scattered ruins and a quarry that goes deep in to the ground. An eerie Silent Hill effect wavers over this point of interest. If you're easily scared, don't go here. We did see this little cute echidna and Grenouille managed to snap

######Port Arthur
Resting on Port Arthur for the night, everything closes at 8pm. Literally, everything. Grenouille and I got a ch√¢let at [Port Arthur Villas](www.portarthurvillas.com.au) and they took us in late at night without much ado. A bit pricey for my liking, but what the hell, we're on holidays afterall! Wonderful room with amazing views. Awesome breakfast in the morning too!

Before we turned it in we headed down the road to a recommendation from our innkeeper to the [Port Arthur Historic Site](www.portarthur.org.au) bistro restuarant. Greeted by the lovliest old queen _(yasss, kween üôåüèª)_ who tended to our whims and needs. Heck, he even gave up 4 of his own cigarettes because no shops where open when we were leaving! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Dinner was an amazing salmon dish served on a bed of noodles. Wonderful!

#####Day 2 Thursday _(jour deux jeudi)_

######Callington Mill - Oatlands

After a brief stop for petrol at the town before, I ducked in quickly to the local candy store leaving Grenouille wondering where I was! üòÅ

{% img center /images/20160218.iPhone6Plus.142116.jpg.jpg 600 800 '' '' %}

On we headed to see the local windmill which was easy to see from afar, just proving tricky to find up close. The Callington Mill is a working Gregorian windmill built in 1837. That's all I can say about it. It's not really that exciting, and there's nothing to tell about it. üòï To make the story more exciting, there were `#wasps` nearby.

Being a little hungry we headed into town to try the Pancake and Crepe Shop. Without going into it too much here on this page, please feel free to head over to [Yelp!](www.yelp.com.au) to check out my review [here](www.yelp.com.au/biz/pancake-and-crepe-shop-oatlands?hrid=MMilTdyaqky-Y6WBopiu6g&utm_source=oshare). In short, it was crap. Everything about this place was crap. I'd love to know that in time, people are able to go here and give a higher rating than I was.

{% img center /images/20160218.iPhone6Plus.132555.jpg 800 800 '' '' %}

######Spring Vale Vineyards - Cranbrook
Whenever I think of Vineyards, I think of rich snobby cunts or those that like to think they're rich snobby cunts - the complete opposite here! Greeted warmly and with welcome that reminds me of my father inviting people to the dinner table to share a meal. We tried every type of white and red on the menu walking away with a 750mL of white and smaller bottle of red. I'll keep these as a memory to share with Grenouille in a month from now when I see him on Adelaide. We had a quick tour of the vineyards and just enjoyed a casual stroll amongst the vines. Lovely.

######Coles Bay
Unfortunately I can't find my pictures from this location and will have to go back through my Lightroom catalog to see where they went. I hope I haven't lost them! üò∞ I took some amazing photos here and almost fell off a cliff getting them! üò° Coles Bay gives you surmountable views of the ocean.

######Wineglass Bay
Wineglass Bay is a bit of a hike up the mountain. You need to purchase access for your car at the local centre on the way down or risk getting a fine. At least the car ticket allows up to 8 people to access the park and climb up. I met a young couple who were taking _(or trying to)_ romantic photos of one another. Being a complete sucker to help people capture memories the way their imagination sees it, I took her camera and snapped a few wonderful shots of them wit hthe view of the water behind them. She was a bit stuck up. But meh. üòè

I quickly also snuck in an image of these Asian tourists sitting down to rest. When Grenouille and I were reviewing photos he asked me _"Do you know these people? Are they your friends?" LOL, no dear. I love you because you're so silly sometimes. üòò I'm a photographer in the making, I capture memories.

######Bicheno &amp; Penguin Tour
Aren't penguins just the darnest little things? Theys're so adorable and the firs thing that comes to mind when I say penguin in most kids my age is Pengu! We arrived in the town of Bicheno but unfortunately as I hadn't booked far enough in advance like Grenouille asked me to we didn't rest here for the night. We had to continue on to St Helens - much further down the way!

The town of Bicheno is quite small, almost just a tourist destination. We had dinner at [Sea Life Centre]() and unfortunately it's the second place that I was absolutely disgusted at the level of service and hospitality received. Not for myself and Grenouille, but for this poor Asian tourist family of 3 _(trois personnes)_. It wasn't anything short of dispicable. I'm yet to write up a review on Yelp! about this place, but believe me it won't be anything short of the truth. The food here was also a bit of a let down. Fish of the Day was Broadfish and really was a reflection of their patronage.

{@ img center /images/20160218.iPhone6Plus.200417.jpg 800 800 'Fish of the Day - Broadfish' 'Fish of the Day - Broadfish' %}

After dinner we moved over to the [Bicheno Penguin Tour](www.bichenopenguintours.com.au) carpark and bought our tickets ready to board bus no. 4 _(autobus qnumero quatre)_ to head off and see these darling little birds. Unknown to me, these are the same penguins on Granite Island off the coast of Victor Harbour, SA.

The tour was licensed by some commission and they help in the repopulation of penguins in Australia. As penguins are light sensitive animals, photography of any kind wasn't allowed so I couldn't snap any photos for the two of us. We were supposed to write to them asking for photos but I've forgotten to do this at the time of writing so when this post gets re-edited, I'll have to add a pic of what we saw to this article. Grenouille has the pics already. I'm just a banana! _(Je suis un banane!)_ üçå

######Tidal Waters Resort St Helens
Wow...remember people to book your accomodation WELL in advance of travel, else end up like us travelling for an hour to the town a few clicks down the road for a night stay! I don't have much to say about this place except the accomodation was great, the in-house services was amazing and if you ever want to get married give this place a look. They have all the services you'd expect from a 4&#189; star accomodation rating. Beautiful! And the best part wasn't even having to move the car to the carpark. The night manager let us keep it slap-bang in the middle of the driveway! We were up early enough to have breakfast but didn't make it in time. üòÅ A fantastic recommendation from the said manager in the morning started our journey the very next day, jour trois vendredi! 

#####Day 3 Friday _(jour trois vendredi)_

######Mohr and Smith

Following the recommendation from our place of stay, we left our car in place and walked the 8 mins to the shop. Yes, this was much against my desire to walk but what choice did I have? I am the lazy Cochon (üê∑) and he is the Grenouille! So around the corner we did walk with a quick stop to grab some cash _(rub your chin when you say that aloud, it has a good effect!)_ and to be honest - it looked like a Mercerella Bros venue than somewhere you'd expect to have brunch. First impressions from the outside blew me away the moment we stepped through the door and greeted by the wonderful man serving coffee at the bar who politely told us to discover a place we feel comfortable and he'll be right over.

We grabbed a menu at the door as we walked in so that means I could start to devour the food mentally without having to wait hand and foot on the service of the staff. In this case the only staff member in sight!

I went with the French Toast üá´üá∑ served with caramelised apples and marscapone. This was nothing short of amazing! üòç The bread was lightly toasted, brioche in style, with a sufficient drizzle of flavour begging you to take more. It was like the devil had created a dish to keep the gluttons being glutonous!

{% img center /images/2016.0219.iPhone6Plus.103404.jpg 800 800 'French Toast' 'French toast, caramelised apples & marscapone cheese' %}

Wonderful fast service, friendly atmosphere, a real Sydney _chic_ vibe to be found here right in the heart of Tasmanian country. This place deserves its 5-star rating on Yelp! If I could move this to anywhere, it would be Pyrmont in Sydney. Perfect all round! Try it if you ever get to pass through on the way to anywhere!

######Bay of Fires
Bay of Fires _(named so in 1773)_ is an amazing secluded beach stretching from Binnalong Bay right up around the coast. It took us a few tries to get close enough to the rocks we could see in the distance and listening to some of my favourite tracks on the iPhone and then braving the wilderness barefoot to get there, but we did in the end. Poor Grenouille really is delicate and couldn't stand on the hot Australian sand or rough ground without hurting his poor soles! I should have been nice enough to pick him up, but in my usual I was too busy laughing or well, just laughing.

Apart from the wasps, and nearly being dragged out to the ocean trying to catch an amazing shot of the water splashing against the foot of the orange hued rocks, there is nothing here short of paradise.

Rather than talk about it, look over these images. I've also uploaded an album to my Flickr account that you can look at with the hi-res images of all these pics and more.

After the Bay of Fires, we headed back to St Helens to grab some grapes, local cheeses, crackers and soda water before our trip back to Hobart. Unfortunately, as luck would have it, we didn't rest where we expected for the night and ended up in a town about 30min west of Hobart called Tynwald at an amazing home-run cottage called Tynwald Willow Bend Estate.

######Tynwald Willow Bend Estate

Unfortunately I have no photos of the estate itself, but they can be found on [Google Images](images.google.com). Greeted by _(what I believe is the husband)_ of the lady that I spoke to on the phone, I was ushered through the manor to the dining room, the reading room, the the breakfast room and then to a book on the [Salamanca Markets](www.hobartcity.com.au/hobart/hobart_events/salamanca_market). She has a fried that runs the bee stall closest to the entrance. Grenouille and I dropped off our things, had a spa, shower, got dressed then headed to town for dinner. If you're ever in the area, give it a go. It's wonderful. Very old fashioned and run the way a manor should and you'd not want or need for anything as the family-run estate has it all. It is a little behind the times but you'll love the feel if you miss your grandma's house from when you were a child. Re-living it as an adult gives you a sense of when things were simpler and people were innocent.

######Rockwall Bar and Grill
How this place is a bar is beyong me. You walk to the end of Salamanca Pl 

#####Day 4 Saturday _(jour quatre samedi)_

######Salamanca Markets

######MONA - Museum of Old and New Art

Bringing it down to a brief outline, we travelled on day 1 _(jour un)_ to 

Day 3 _(jour trois)_ Grenouille and I went to [Sea Life Centre](!www.yelp.com.au/biz/sea-life-centre-bicheno) and wow! That's all I can say. Not a good _wow_ like [Lydia](!youtu.be/Z5C6vd3blq0) gives, a REALLY bad kind of _Wow!_. What the fuck was wrong with these people? The menu has been translated to English and yet you treat your Asian customers with a direct sense of distain and contempt! I don't know what allowed me to sit silently and watch, I wanted to butt in but the family of three conceeded to take a seat at a different table than the one they wanted.

There was a language barrier, I admit that, but the family only asked if they could have that table by the window - and you agreed. So why didn't you just sit them down at the table and clear it for them? Honestly the amount of time you spent berrating that poor family and sitting on the couches before they could have the table because you had to clear it wasn't all that bad, was it? I've been to many a restaurant and been sat at the table and had someone clear it quickly. All you had to do was put down 3 small plates, forks, knives and serviettes. Clearly it was an obstacle or you just really hate that family? I don't know.

Anyway, on behalf of that family, I'd like to extend a really big and warm "Fuck you, Sea Life Centre! Fuck you and your shitty service and treating people like children!"

If you don't want to be nice to Asian people, don't have a fucking Asian translated menu. In fact, don't serve me. Don't serve the other patrons. Don't serve anyone. Get on a boat and fuck off down to Antartica. Let a polar bear eat you, or something.

![Polar Bear](/images/2016-02-20_polarbear.jpg)

In short - don't eat at the following places until they improve their customer service to a standard:

- Pancake &amp; Crepe Shop
- Sea Life Centre

Everywhere else is OK üòâ
