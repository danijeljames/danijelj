Sitting on my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, QF77, retrospectivey I have mixed emotions about the hospitality of people from Tasmania. In this hand it had to be one of the worst places for anyone to experience a welcome in all of Australia. And that includes Sydney. Disgusting. What happened to the good framework that this country was built upon? My travelling companion Grenouille (üê∏), may not have been able to understand the dymanics of three particular situations that played out at hand but I certainly did! On the other hand we were greeted like a lost stranger that had a reservation waiting to be fulfilled.

I arrived at [Hobart Internaitional Airport](!www.hotbartinternational.com.au) and was taken back at how small this place was. Really? This is an international travel destination? It's not even half the size of the old Adelaide International Airport before it was revamped a few years ago. Weird.

Getting off the plane my first messages from Grenouille warm and fuzzy until I was told the car licence was forgot and left behind. LOL! Double LOL! So Grenouille went back towards his place of stay and I resorted to my UK licence. Yes, scary as it may be for a lot of people, I do have a valid international licence and it won't be taken away from me. Yet. üòù

First up was Thank you for the welcome at [RedSpot](!www.redspot.com.au), your assistance was amazing! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è You were friendly, welcoming, and extremely helpful. I would just like to mention you with a shout-out here on my blog. Thank you! üëçüèª

Bringing it right down to a shorter post, we travelled around Tasmania on Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi and Samedi.

#####Day 1 Wednesday _(jour un mercredi)_

######Sorell Fruit Farm
Amazing little farm a short stint out of Hobart. Bit annoyed that we couldn't go into the farm with just a single bucket between the two of us. We didn't really need two buckets _(large punnets)_ between us to collect 3 apples, 2 pears and a handful of strawberries. Was fun! Grenouille couldn't pick a strawberry to save a life, but decided to steal mine to make the punnet look nice and plump. Pears were small but juicy. Nashi pears to be exact. Apples were yellow-ish in colour but nice. Strawberries were almost all gone but having worked on the Beerenberg Farm myself a few years back I knew how to pick them. The staff were a bit touchy with some of the Asian tourists who just wanted to walk around the orchards to look whilst one of them picked them. So they too were forced to buy a bucket each. Maybe they could fix this business model?

######Tasmanian Devil Park
This was a little bit of a disappointment. It's the Tasmanian Devil Park Unzoo. It's not a "zoo" per se, but they help in the breeding and conservation of the Tasmanian Devil. Unbeknown to most, the Tasmanian Devil suffers from a cancer that is transmitted by blood - much like the HIV virus. And also like the HIV virus, we don't know where it came from _(the cancer)_. My favourite part was going out to the Kangaroos to play, watching Quolls devour an animal carcass and the feeding of the Tasmanian Devil. So voracious! Both of them! Who ever thought a Quoll was such a savage eater! üò∞

######Eaglehawk Neck Historic Site
Eaglehawk Neck had some natural formations that really take a moment to let sink into the mind. The Tessellated Pavement Slate Reserve down on the beach shore looked like tiles laid by man from above, upon closer inspection we reaslised it was natural formations from erosion of the stone over years from the ocean.

######Coal Mines
I didn't take my camera with me, so I have no real images of this place. It's a long walk of scattered ruins and a quarry that goes deep in to the ground. An eerie Silent Hill effect wavers over this point of interest. If you're easily scared, don't go here. We did see this little cute echidna and Grenouille managed to snap

######Port Arthur
Resting on Port Arthur for the night, everything closes at 8pm. Literally, everything. Grenouille and I got a ch√¢let at [Port Arthur Villas](www.portarthurvillas.com.au) and they took us in late at night without much ado. A bit pricey for my liking, but what the hell, we're on holidays afterall! Wonderful room with amazing views. Awesome breakfast in the morning too!

Before we turned it in we headed down the road to a recommendation from our innkeeper to the [Port Arthur Historic Site](www.portarthur.org.au) bistro restuarant. Greeted by the lovliest old queen _(yasss, kween üôåüèª)_ who tended to our whims and needs. Heck, he even gave up 4 of his own cigarettes because no shops where open when we were leaving! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Dinner was an amazing salmon dish served on a bed of noodles. Wonderful!

#####Day 2 Thursday _(jour deux jeudi)_

######Callington Mill - Oatlands

After a brief stop for petrol at the town before, I ducked in quickly to the local candy store leaving Grenouille wondering where I was! üòÅ

On we headed to see the local windmill which was easy to see from afar, just proving tricky to find up close. The Callington Mill is a working Gregorian windmill built in 1837. That's all I can say about it. It's not really that exciting, and there's nothing to tell about it. üòï To make the story more exciting, there were `#wasps` nearby.

Being a little hungry we headed into town to try the Pancake and Crepe Shop. Without going into it too much here on this page, please feel free to head over to [Yelp!](www.yelp.com.au) to check out my review [here](www.yelp.com.au/biz/pancake-and-crepe-shop-oatlands?hrid=MMilTdyaqky-Y6WBopiu6g&utm_source=oshare). In short, it was crap. Everything about this place was crap. I'd love to know that in time, people are able to go here and give a higher rating than I was.

######Spring Vale Vineyards - Cranbrook
Whenever I think of Vineyards, I think of rich snobby cunts or those that like to think they're rich snobby cunts - the complete opposite here! Greeted warmly and with welcome that reminds me of my father inviting people to the dinner table to share a meal. We tried every type of white and red on the menu walking away with a 750mL of white and smaller bottle of red. I'll keep these as a memory to share with Grenouille in a month from now when I see him on Adelaide. We had a quick tour of the vineyards and just enjoyed a casual stroll amongst the vines. Lovely.

######Coles Bay
Unfortunately I can't find my pictures from this location and will have to go back through my Lightroom catalog to see where they went. I hope I haven't lost them! üò∞ I took some amazing photos here and almost fell off a cliff getting them! üò° Coles Bay gives you surmountable views of the ocean.

######Wineglass Bay
Wineglass Bay is a bit of a hike up the mountain. You need to purchase access for your car at the local centre on the way down or risk getting a fine. At least the car ticket allows up to 8 people to access the park and climb up. I met a young couple who were taking _(or trying to)_ romantic photos of one another. Being a complete sucker to help people capture memories the way their imagination sees it, I took her camera and snapped a few wonderful shots of them wit hthe view of the water behind them. She was a bit stuck up. But meh. üòè

I quickly also snuck in an image of these Asian tourists sitting down to rest. When Grenouille and I were reviewing photos he asked me _"Do you know these people? Are they your friends?" LOL, no dear. I love you because you're so silly sometimes. üòò I'm a photographer in the making, I capture memories.

#####Day 3 Friday _(jour trois vendredi)_

#####Day 4 Saturday _(jour quatre samedi)_



Bringing it down to a brief outline, we travelled on day 1 _(jour un)_ to 

Day 3 _(jour trois)_ Grenouille and I went to [Sea Life Centre](!www.yelp.com.au/biz/sea-life-centre-bicheno) and wow! That's all I can say. Not a good _wow_ like [Lydia](!youtu.be/Z5C6vd3blq0) gives, a REALLY bad kind of _Wow!_. What the fuck was wrong with these people? The menu has been translated to English and yet you treat your Asian customers with a direct sense of distain and contempt! I don't know what allowed me to sit silently and watch, I wanted to butt in but the family of three conceeded to take a seat at a different table than the one they wanted.

There was a language barrier, I admit that, but the family only asked if they could have that table by the window - and you agreed. So why didn't you just sit them down at the table and clear it for them? Honestly the amount of time you spent berrating that poor family and sitting on the couches before they could have the table because you had to clear it wasn't all that bad, was it? I've been to many a restaurant and been sat at the table and had someone clear it quickly. All you had to do was put down 3 small plates, forks, knives and serviettes. Clearly it was an obstacle or you just really hate that family? I don't know.

Anyway, on behalf of that family, I'd like to extend a really big and warm "Fuck you, Sea Life Centre! Fuck you and your shitty service and treating people like children!"

If you don't want to be nice to Asian people, don't have a fucking Asian translated menu. In fact, don't serve me. Don't serve the other patrons. Don't serve anyone. Get on a boat and fuck off down to Antartica. Let a polar bear eat you, or something.

![Polar Bear](/images/2016-02-20_polarbear.jpg)

In short - don't eat at the following places until they improve their customer service to a standard:

- Pancake &amp; Crepe Shop
- Sea Life Centre

Everywhere else is OK üòâ
