Sitting on my Jetstar flight back to Sydney, QF77, retrospectivey I have mixed emotions about the hospitality of people from Tasmania. In this hand it had to be one of the worst places for anyone to experience a welcome in all of Australia. And that includes Sydney. Disgusting. What happened to the good framework that this country was built upon? My travelling companion Grenouille (üê∏), may not have been able to understand the dymanics of three particular situations that played out at hand but I certainly did! On the other hand we were greeted like a lost stranger that had a reservation waiting to be fulfilled.

I arrived at [Hobart Internaitional Airport](!www.hotbartinternational.com.au) and was taken back at how small this place was. Really? This is an international travel destination? It's not even half the size of the old Adelaide International Airport before it was revamped a few years ago. Weird.

Getting off the plane my first messages from Grenouille warm and fuzzy until I was told the car licence was forgot and left behind. LOL! Double LOL! So Grenouille went back towards his place of stay and I resorted to my UK licence. Yes, scary as it may be for a lot of people, I do have a valid international licence and it won't be taken away from me. Yet. üòù

First up was Thank you for the welcome at [RedSpot](!www.redspot.com.au), your assistance was amazing! 5-Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è You were friendly, welcoming, and extremely helpful. I would just like to mention you with a shout-out here on my blog. Thank you! üëçüèª

Bringing it right down to a shorter post, we travelled around Tasmania on Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi and Samedi.

#####Day 1 Wednesday _(jour un mercredi)_

######Sorell Fruit Farm
Amazing little farm a short stint out of Hobart. Bit annoyed that we couldn't go into the farm with just a single bucket between the two of us. We didn't really need two buckets _(large punnets)_ between us to collect 3 apples, 2 pears and a handful of strawberries. Was fun! Grenouille couldn't pick a strawberry to save a life, but decided to steal mine to make the punnet look nice and plump. Pears were small but juicy. Nashi pears to be exact. Apples were yellow-ish in colour but nice. Strawberries were almost all gone but having worked on the Beerenberg Farm myself a few years back I knew how to pick them. The staff were a bit touchy with some of the Asian tourists who just wanted to walk around the orchards to look whilst one of them picked them. So they too were forced to buy a bucket each. Maybe they could fix this business model?

######Tasmanian Devil Park
This was a little bit of a disappointment. It's the Tasmanian Devil Park Unzoo. It's not a "zoo" per se, but they help in the breeding and conservation of the Tasmanian Devil. Unbeknown to most, the Tasmanian Devil suffers from a cancer that is transmitted by blood - much like the HIV virus. And also like the HIV virus, we don't know where it came from _(the cancer)_. My favourite part was going out to the Kangaroos to play, watching Quolls devour an animal carcass and the feeding of the Tasmanian Devil. So voracious! Both of them! Who ever thought a Quoll was such a savage eater! üò∞

######Eaglehawk Neck Historic Site
Eaglehawk Neck had some natural formations that really take a moment to let sink into the mind. The Tessellated Pavement Slate Reserve down on the beach shore looked like tiles laid by man from above, upon closer inspection we reaslised it was natural formations from erosion of the stone over years from the ocean.

#####Day 2 Thursday _(jour deux jeudi)_

#####Day 3 Friday _(jour trois vendredi)_

#####Day 4 Saturday _(jour quatre samedi)_



Bringing it down to a brief outline, we travelled on day 1 _(jour un)_ to 

Day 3 _(jour trois)_ Grenouille and I went to [Sea Life Centre](!www.yelp.com.au/biz/sea-life-centre-bicheno) and wow! That's all I can say. Not a good _wow_ like [Lydia](!youtu.be/Z5C6vd3blq0) gives, a REALLY bad kind of _Wow!_. What the fuck was wrong with these people? The menu has been translated to English and yet you treat your Asian customers with a direct sense of distain and contempt! I don't know what allowed me to sit silently and watch, I wanted to butt in but the family of three conceeded to take a seat at a different table than the one they wanted.

There was a language barrier, I admit that, but the family only asked if they could have that table by the window - and you agreed. So why didn't you just sit them down at the table and clear it for them? Honestly the amount of time you spent berrating that poor family and sitting on the couches before they could have the table because you had to clear it wasn't all that bad, was it? I've been to many a restaurant and been sat at the table and had someone clear it quickly. All you had to do was put down 3 small plates, forks, knives and serviettes. Clearly it was an obstacle or you just really hate that family? I don't know.

Anyway, on behalf of that family, I'd like to extend a really big and warm "Fuck you, Sea Life Centre! Fuck you and your shitty service and treating people like children!"

If you don't want to be nice to Asian people, don't have a fucking Asian translated menu. In fact, don't serve me. Don't serve the other patrons. Don't serve anyone. Get on a boat and fuck off down to Antartica. Let a polar bear eat you, or something.

In short - don't eat at the following places until they improve their customer service to a standard:

- Pancake &amp; Crepe Shop
- Sea Life Centre

Everywhere else is OK üòâ
