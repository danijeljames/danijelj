Arriving back here in Adelaide on March 3rd this year, one of the first things I did was take to social platform [Grindr](http://www.grindr.com) to get a feel from everyone where the best coffee shops were. Yesterday I was talking to Jakey and asked him if he's ever heard of [Paddy's Lantern](http://paddyslantern.com.au). Unfortunately not, and I did leave it to the last two of places to still check out.

I can't remember who referred me this venue, but thank you, whoever you are ! It was an absolute delight !

Nested in the suburban district of Adelaide hidden amongst the old houses at 219 Gilbert Street, this little niche cafe can be found.

The food was amazing, coffee was amazing and to top it off - the service was brilliant !

I picked myself the _2 Fried Eggs w/ Spicy Relish on Sourdough Toast_ and at only $13 this was a total bargain ! You can't go wrong with the perfectly cooked eggs, rustic sourdough, and devilish homemade spicy relish. Mmmmm !

I also got my standard large size soy latte, no sugar as this is what I really came for. Keeping up standards, I had it served in a takeaway cup. I was a little taken back by the service of being offered my cup still on a saucer, and not just handed to me.

The print on the cups is faded, but even so it's still so cute ! ðŸ˜Š I can't delay my observations of a full bodied flavour with amazing texture steamed perfectly and no burning with a lasting aroma - wow ! This has to be _the_ coffee in Adelaide. They deserve the 4&frac12; stars awarded to them on [Yelp!](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/paddys-lantern-adelaide) too !

If you're in the area and you want amazing breakfast, please head on down there, bring your partner, work colleagues or a friend and enjoy the simplicity of the atmosphere, the warmth of the service, the spectacular tastes of the products and most importantly - experience it for yourself !
