Ever had the idea to fusion two dishes together and hope it go well? I did. And it worked! 🙌🏻

Taking the idea of carbonara being a white-sauced bacon dish and pumpkin fetta pasta, I thought to myself, why can't I make this into two new dishes? It can't be that hard, can it?

First things first, Jake likes spicy food. Not spicy enough to burn a new hole in your arse, but something nice. 🌶🌶🌶😋 Why not try to make the base of both these dishes into something new and use some of my chipotle sauce to bring it together? It's worth a shot! 🔫

Pumpkin in a pasta dish need to be firm, so I took some kent and butternut pumpkins and roasted them with olive oil, thyme, cracked pepper and salt crystals and ground salt for ~45mins @ 180°C _(fan forced)_ and then left them in there until I was ready. I did turn them about half way through to make sure they baked evenly.

On to the main dish. Starting with onion, I sweated it until it became translucent and added chilli then chicken and a glob of my chipotle sauce. It needed to mix around and get juicy on a low temperature to bind the flavours. Added some more salt.

Why all the salt? Well, saw this crazy Korean woman _(Maangchi)_ on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/?gl=AU&hl=en-GB) when she started with a [Korean style iced coffee - Naeng-keopi: 냉커피](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zNKal3PI_Q) and then followed her around and saw lots of videos that use salt - a lot of salt! I'm surprised she didn't put salt in her iced coffee! 😂

Anyway, back to the dish at hand. 😁

So then you skin and chop up some mushrooms, fry for a bit on low heat, add chopped bacon, fry some more, add &frac12; cup of white wine _(something cheap will do)_, add &frac12; cup of chicken or vegetable stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins. Add the chicken stuff to this, including all the juices and add about &frac12; cup of cream and simmer for 10 mins.

Right before serving, add the pumpkin we made earlier and some baby spinach and stir until the spinach is wilted. Get your pasta ready and put it on the bowls, scoop some sauce on top and serve!

I get called a `#masterchef` by Jake all the time. Half of me believes because he loves me so much, the other half because of the taste I procure to his palate!

A clean bowl is a perfect dish ✌️
