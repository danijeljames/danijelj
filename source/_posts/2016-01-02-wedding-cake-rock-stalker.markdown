Is it just me, or does this picture look creepy with my friend [Tommy](https://www.instagram.com/theonlymrtommyschroeter/) being all weird and stalker-like behind me here at [Wedding Cake Rock](https://www.sydneycoastwalks.com.au/2015/11/where-is-wedding-cake-rock/) kinda freak people out? It reminds me of a horror movie or something! ðŸ‘»

My favourite image of all-time from Wedding Cake Rock was by [Harley Kingsley](https://www.instagram.com/harleykingsley81/) a few weeks later.
