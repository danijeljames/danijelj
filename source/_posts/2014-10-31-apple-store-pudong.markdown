A recent trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai, China</a> I was able to venture to the Pudong district and see the <a href="https://www.apple.com/cn/retail/pudong/">Apple Store</a> which has a grand entrance.

Much to my suprise when I came back to Australia and today I was applying for a job with <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/">Apple</a> and I saw the same Apple Store in the header images!
