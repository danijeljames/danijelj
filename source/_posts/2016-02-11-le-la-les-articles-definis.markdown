**le**, **la** and **les** are French for **the**.

Making the distinction between masculine _(m)_ and feminine _(f)_ objects, we use le for masculine and la for feminine.

Plural form of all objecs is les regardless of whatever gender is occupied.

In the instance when there is a combination of _(m)_ and _(f)_ objects, the precedence always falls back on the _(m)_. This applies to true to ils and elles too.

| Anglais | Français |
|:---|:---|
| the| le _(m)_ |
| | la _(f)_ |
| | les _(plural)_ |
