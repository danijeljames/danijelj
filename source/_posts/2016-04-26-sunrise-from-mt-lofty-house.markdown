I wasn't feeling well on the weekend and so my dear brought me dinner last night and a random visit which seemed to _bump_ me back into life and get me happy and alive again. No longer do I look or feel like death reheated.

Not sure how to repay my dear, so I got up at 5:30 in the morning and went to Mt Lofty to see where I could find an amazing vantage point for the sunrise.

I discovered Mt Lofty House. I might have to plan a secret weekend getaway for the two of us up there sometime in the folding cold of winter and steal my dear away.

Captured three images, but this is the low-res version of one of them.

Good morning everyone !
