A late start today. I had intended to get up early, go out, have coffee and pastry, peruse around the city soaking in the places I've not seen since yesteryear and try to find the new changes. I was only here recently in Adelaide for the Healthdirect Christmas break plus a few days, but I was more of a tourist then. I had no intentions to settle down here for a bit and stand still a little while. Now I'm back&nbsp;!

Badger _(his nickname, I didn't give it to 'im)_ has given me a recommendation for coffee this morning. I finally got to the city just after 13:00 and had a walk down memory lane - [Leigh St](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Leigh+St,+Adelaide+SA+5000/@-34.8450789,138.5735432,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x6ab0cf28363480a7:0xa7fac227eb958f23) - where years ago my ex partner Mike and I had a cafe. Actually, we had a cafe on Leigh St, Topham Mall and ... I forgot the connecting street on the other side of Leigh St. I wanna say Bent St, but that doesn't sound right. I guess I could [Google](https://maps.google.com.au) it, meh.

So anyway, got into the city, walked down Leigh St, fabulous culture nestled up here hidden away from the dredges of Hindley St. No hookers. Drugs. Habbibi's. Nada! I spotted a little French restaurant that I'd like to go back and try this week, people sitting outside laughing and enjoying their Indian meals _(were they Halal ?)_ and the vibe was just there. It's almost brewing into a hipster lifestyle.

Stumbling up the little lane with my eyes peeled for everything around me, I found [coffee branch](https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/coffee-branch-adelaide), a virtual hole-in-the-wall type shop. You shuffle in, you order, you shuffle out with coffee in hand and some pastry too! I myself got a [Milo-flavoured](http://www.milo.com.au) cronut. First thing I noticed was the style. Very hipster! If I closed my eyes and opened them between Newtown and Adelaide I'd hardly notice any difference. The price of soy, coconut and almond milk was a little steep _(80¬¢ vs 50¬¢ in Sydney)_ but well worth it for the overall cost. Friendly staff, amazing decor, profiled origin, chalkboards, a grade of rustic - it was pretty much love at first sight!

I ordered my usual large soy latte, no sugar thnx ‚òïÔ∏è ‚úåüèª

After a few minutes they called out my name and I shuffled out of the store and out the front to the tables to grab a quick snap of my cup. It's totally adorable!

Any shop that wants to precede it's reputation will use custom printed cups. Not only does it embed their brand in my mind, it's associative with the quality - let's tuck in!

First sip, clearly burnt my tongue. Why do I do this every time to myself ? Seriously I'm stupid at the best of times ! üòÇ Maybe this is why I'm single still ? üòè Second sip, yeurk! What is this ? It's strong ! It's real coffee ! I honestly hadn't expected this. I need another sip. _*sips coffee*_ Wow ! This is amazing !

I can safely say this is a 4.5 star rating coffee from me to you. I'm going to review them later on Yelp! and go back for some more photos of the joint. I'm adding this to a list later and will be back to visit sometime again soon. Give it a shot ! _(excuse the pun)_
