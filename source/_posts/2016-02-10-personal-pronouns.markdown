Struggling with Personal Pronouns? There's 5 main ones we use in English: me, you, s/he, they. In French we have 6 with the inclusion of all the English pronouns and an additional formaility _(or unfamiliarity)_ addition for "you".

| S/P | French | English |
|:---:|:------:|:-------:|
| Singular | je | me |
| | tu | you |
| | il, elle, on | he, she, we |
| Plural | nous | we |
| | vous | you _(formal)_ |
| | ils, elles | they _(m)_, they _(f)_ |

Trying to remember these is not only important, but also the order they appear as it is dedicated to the structure of learning.
