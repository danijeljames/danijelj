So, scrolling through Yelp! looking for a new place to go eat at and came across the venue [303 By The Sea](https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/303-by-the-sea-henley-beach). We've been there already but had to sit outside because of my indecisiveness. So now we're back and we got a nice table at the back of the room.

The lines are long, it's loud, people are sighing, you're really waiting a while to get served - but who can question the quality of the food being served!? It looks amazing.

Jake wanted a hashbrown, eggs, mushrooms and bacon - just simple. Well, apparently not. After discovering the hashbrowns are a meal unto themselves and can't be served with the condiments I asked for, the chef came over and disagreed with my request. As I asked her, I don't mind how much this is going to cost me - find a suitable price and let me have what I want.

It took them a while to get his food out to us. I really was quite impressed with the quality of my food, but I can't really rave about the experience as a whole. We took to Facebook to make comments about the quality of the experience and endured a tirade from the Madam Chef on Facebook. Sheesh! I don't know what the problem was. Maybe she was having a bad day?

All in all, it's a great place, but I think it'll be some time before we come back here. Maybe in the summertime instead?
