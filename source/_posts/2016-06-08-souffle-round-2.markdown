Just got home from a night at Jake's _(awww....😍😘😍)_ and Tom was eagerly awaiting me to make soufflé for him.

The results ? Of course they're a success ! Jake called me a [MasterChef](https://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef) 😉

I'd like to make food for Jake for the rest of his life. I think my experience with the kitchen and food is enough to bring to our relationship that something that will last our lifetime spent together. I do hope he knows how much I love him. He's the sunshine on a rainy day for me.

Did Tom like the soufflé, naturally of course. Whipped cream and all !
