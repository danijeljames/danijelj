Application Support files _(can be anything from saved states, preferences, caches, temporary files, etc)_:

    ~/Library/Application Support/(App Name)

Preferences are stored at:

    ~/Library/Preferences/(App Name)

Caches are stored in:

    ~/Library/Caches/(App Name)

_**Note:** Sometimes can be referenced by app developer name rather than app name!_
