What does your office window view look like ? Do you even have an office window to look out ? I hope so. Everyone needs a window into the world. Especially our pets. Cats and dogs love being able to look into the world.

Did you ever look into the window as a child when it rained and watched the drops of rain falling from the heavens down on to the ground ? _plop, plop, plop_ ðŸ’§ðŸ’§ðŸ’§ they would crash and splash like tiny meteors. I did. I also loved the sound.

Since moving to Adelaide I've yet to find my office space that I will be working from. Hopefully it will have a nice view of the buildings, sky and all the people running around doing whatever they do best. Such a view would bring me joy.

When I worked for Vimeo, I had a view as grand as the Opera House, the Harbor Bridge, the people in Pitt St Mall, a coffee and cake, or even people walking by ! I technically had no office and worked entirely remotely from my office. That was in New York and here I was in Australia.

I've managed to source my own office here in Adelaide whilst I work on personal projects and spread my wings a little and relax a little more. I'm quite often here in my office but not during the usual business hours. They run 24/7. So you'll have to check my calendar _(sic.)_

I hope your find a place to work, spending 1/3 of your adult life there, where the view is as beautiful as what I've to share.
