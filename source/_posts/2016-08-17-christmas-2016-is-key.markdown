Even though I've already posted today, this is an amendment. Today Jake sat me down at cibo espresso to write out my resume to write out my resume so I can get myself a new position. I've been really down just recently after the departure from DPC.

He gets it. Jake really gets me, or does such a great job pretending that I feel safe and secure. Whilst working on my resume he comes over and pops this down in front of me.

Wow...a Christmas ornament! But not just anything - a keepsake! You want to spend Christmas with me! Does that mean we're going to be a family? Are our dreams going to be a reality for the two of us?

Hello world, Jake and Danijel, are a family. We are slowly getting there. It will be another year or three, but we're going to be our own family one day!
