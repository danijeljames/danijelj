So who would have ever thought that I'd be intersted in sport? Not me, that's for sure. It's Friday and Jake's organised something for us to do. What exactly I'm not sure. But why would I care? As long as I'm spending time with him I just know that my life is the greatest achievement.

We ended up first at a restaurant on North Tce that I hadn't been to, but eyeing off since I got back to Adelaide. Argentinian influenced steak house/tapas bar. Service was a bit below par, but the waitress lightened up the mood. Food was incredibly juicy and I really liked it.

[La Boca](https://www.yelp.com.au/biz/la-boca-bar-and-grill-adelaide) is generally pretty busy from what I've observed each time I've been past so it was great to finally get in here and have a look at the place.

Heading down to the football we grabbed a drink each and went down to our favourite spot. It's not the first time I've come to the football with Jake and I feel like he's opened my eyes to appreciate the simpler things in life I've learned to reject. Maybe I should pick a team and get a season pass for the two of us? That would make a nice surprise and we'll finally start to accumulate elements in our life which belong to nobody else but ourselves.

After the football match we went down to the carpark to find some Pokémon to build up our Pokédex more. Bored with this we went on to the Alpine Winter Village on North Tce. What do we see apart from crap food and llamas? Ice arena! Fuck yes!

Poor Jake fell over totally whilst I was busy filming a selfie video. He fell just out of the frame and I had tears literally flowing freely as I keeled over to laugh instead of going over to help him. What kind of a boyfriend am I? The worst kind!

Before the night was over we stopped in at a little photo booth van to get 4 black and white selfies - the old style selfie - in a film strip. I love this photo so much of us. I've never had a chance to do something cool and fun like this all my life and secretly always been jealous of the people that keep images like this in their wallet. Thank you Jake. This was an amazing night. You're the greatest.
