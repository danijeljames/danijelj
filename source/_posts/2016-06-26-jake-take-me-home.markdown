How did the day start? Perfect. I went to get Jake to start the day. 😍

First we went to the HMAS Adelaide Open Day.

Afterwards Jake and I were supposed to go on the Dolphin Cruise _(he's so sneaky, he organised this without telling me!)_ but we missed that because the tour of the ship took longer than it was supposed to. How did I ever deserve this man? What did I do? I don't know. All I know, is this is the perfect life.

We thought about it, and I suggested Hahndorf. On the way, we went to a winery to do a cheese and wine testing. I've never done this before! So why not?

Jake brought me to Shaw &amp; Smith cellar door where we took a flight. A wine flight! Did you know that? Tell me I'm not the only silly person who doesn't know these things? A wine flight!? Ha! What a cute name. So we took a trip together.

After this wonderful matching we headed into Hahndorf, stopped at a market, then across the road to the candy shop and then back here.

Unfortunately after dinner I had to bring Jake home. He wasn't feeling well and wouldn't have been able to sleep at my place because the bed is quite hard. 😔

>Jake, take me home...

That's right, I can hardly hold back my anticipation. There is going to be a day in the future, when I can fall over drunk and turn to this man, and say to him, _"Jake, take me home"_ and we'll be going back to the same place that we both share together. Our house. Our home. And we'll have a cute dog.

Hopefully the lady next door won't grow ugly tulips so I don't have to complain! 😂

>11:11, make a wish...

It's just passed 11:11 as I'm writing this, so make a wish. ✨

My wish, is simple. For Jake &amp; Danijel `#jakeanddanijel` to enjoy a long and wonderful life full of laughter, smiles and wonderful memories.

Goodnight!
